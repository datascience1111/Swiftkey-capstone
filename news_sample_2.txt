"This Roscoe Village organic bakery bills itself as offering \"punk rock pastry.\" And if that means many of the goodies are surprisingly inventive, I would have to agree. Sure, you'll find the standards: brownies, cookies, whoopie pies and cheesecake bars, all generously sized, by the way. And there's a gorgeous, postcard-perfect vista of cupcakes on display — about a dozen flavors available each month, four to six of them vegan. However, foodies will appreciate the assortment of thoughtful creations such as chocolate chip cookies with bacon (yes, the bacon is organic), blueberry pie with lavender streusel, basil and goat cheese croissants, tequila-lime cupcakes and ginger-cream scones. And speaking of scones, the vegan Take a Hike scones, made with whole-wheat flour, oats, seeds and dried fruit, are the bakery's best-seller. Most items are sweetened with evaporated cane juice. Extra bonus: With its tattoo-art touches and neon-hued walls and tables, the shop has a punk rock feel too."

"When people are upset around them, it is important as well to reassure children that the divorce is not their fault.

When new leaves are starting to grow and are less than an inch long, apply a horticultural oil or an insecticide containing the natural ingredient spinosad.

"When we've tried to take this series of bumps in the past at higher speeds (above 20 mph) in the regular TRD Tacoma, the results were both jarring and unnerving. It was easy to tell we were running outside the suspension setup's capabilities. However, when trying the same section in the Baja Series, the shocks made all the difference. At 20, 30 and 40 mph, the series of ruts and bumps felt like they were getting smoother. In high-range four-wheel drive, we found the best way to keep control of the Tacoma was to keep the revs high (around 3,000 or 4,000 rpm) in 2nd or 3rd gear (depending on speed) and aim for the tops of the whoops.

"Hey, Ted: Flynn must be thoroughly evaluated. Here's what I don't like about him: 1. His size and arm strength are not much different from McCoy's. 2. I'm not sure how much he can lift a mediocre team -- a requirement of a true franchise quarterback. I believe his surrounding cast has lifted him. 3. You just never know how a backup will react when he is elevated to the starting job and all the responsibility falls on him.

"\"It's a little hard to say,\" Veirs says. \"If you took an African child in Mali who heard music of that area and brought them to the States in a different cultural context, would they forget the original music or go forward with that in their heart? My impression is that the first music goes in and informs and makes an impression. There's so much to be learned through music at a young age. I watch my child, at 2, learning rhythm and words. He can say, ‘Mexico,' because we sing ‘Jamaica Farewell' to him - ‘I've been from Maine to Mexico' - and he always jumps in to say, ‘Mexico!' \""

"Making sure the kids get enough exercise in the summer months can be a challenge (\"enough\" being the amount it takes to tire them out so they don't have the energy to drive me crazy). During the school year they have gym and playtime with their classmates to tucker them out, and a trip down to the park can always take that extra edge off. But in the summer, parents have to find new ways to run the rug rats ragged because much like a bored golden retriever chewing up the entire house when left alone, if you don't exercise them, they will destroy everything and everyone you hold dear."

"For this tour, Iglesias is joined by pop-bachata sensations Aventura, who are New Yorkers of Dominican ancestry. Their most recent album \"Kings of Bachata: Sold Out at Madison Square Garden\" (Sony International) demonstrates their teen-pop appeal and is a good introduction to the twangy-guitar sound of bachata."
"Historians hail Munch for breaking away from the Impressionists who still held sway over the art world in the late 19th century.

"\"We buy for each specific store. That is how a department store stays close to the customers who are coming in everyday,\" said Melody Westendors, chief operating officer. Sales associates routinely record information detailing customer requests.

Council Vice President Chris Del Borrello, who presented the idea of bringing more inspections in-house during a presentation on possible areas of savings in the budget earlier this year, was concerned that may mean they could miss out on potential revenue."

"For the better part of a year, Mitt Romney has tethered himself to an array of positions designed for the Republican presidential primaries, stances that put him to the right of where he's been through much of his career and raise questions about where he really wants to go. President Barack Obama's politicking has tacked to the left, thanks to all those speeches to Democratic fundraisers and other activist-heavy events that play up the liberal in him."

"The West has an opportunity in a critical region where it has lost allies in the past few years because of its inability to constrain Iran in the Levant and the Arab gulf region. From the start of the Arab Spring, the Assad regime has, through local media acting as propaganda machines, accused the West of providing financial and logistical support for demonstrators' \"terrorist\" acts. The West has no positive standing to lose with the Assad regime. But supporting the revolutionaries would help guarantee a state in the Levant that could cooperate with, rather than challenge, the West and build a new relationship of trust with the people of Syria, not their oppressor."

"Maybe the larger problem is his point of view. He begins his article by criticizing the festival's mission \"to break the barriers of stereotypes\" because the lineup does \"not actively push that agenda\" because of (in part) our film about mariachi music. Maybe he doesn't realize mariachi is the national music of Mexico? By that rationalization, every American film with jazz or the blues must conform to stereotype. I think he's confusing breaking stereotypes with something else. Just because a Mexican plays mariachi music doesn't make them a stereotype. Just like a Chicagoan playing the blues doesn't equate stereotype. What is stereotypical, is an American assuming that every Mexican holiday is Cinco de Mayo.We would appreciate it if Mr. Stamets could rethink his (admittedly brief) comments about our film and his view of Chicago Latino Film Festival's mission and lineup in a context that maybe he isn't (as of yet) qualified to make them."

As you must know, no federal court has ever been confronted with a constitutional challenge to the government's restriction on what a pastor says from the pulpit. The point of the Pulpit Initiative is to create a legal precedent that restores the right of pastors to speak freely from the pulpit without government censorship or control."

Though it's amusing in small doses, this is the first Aardman film to suffer a serious shortage of sight gags, the first where the whimsy feels forced and the strain shows.

"Sheamus and Daniel Bryan finally had the match fans have been waiting for, and it did not disappoint. Iin the match of the night, both men delivered great twists and turns, with Bryan garnering much of the attention (and fan support) from the Chicago crowd. After Bryan deliberately got himself disqualified after failing to respond to a ref's 5 count leading to the first fall, Bryan locked in the “Yes” lock, leading to fall No. 2 after Sheamus passed out. Once he came to, a rehash of WrestleMania's 18-second match seemed to be the path for fall No. 3, but Bryan kicked out. Eventually, a second Brogue Kick would seal the deal. Though Bryan doesn't hold the World Heavyweight title, he proved that he is a champion in terms of someone who can be counted on to always be one half of a fantastic match in big-stage situations."
