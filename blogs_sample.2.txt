"Today William began his low dose IL-2 infusion. We spent a very long time at the clinic getting some labs test kinks worked out and then due to a shortage of home health nurses, finally got the infusion started around 8pm---at HOME. Despite the mild frustration from all the waiting and delays today, it is all better than being in the hospital. Normally this infusion is started under 24 hour observation in the hospital. However, William previously tolerated the low dose infusion just fine so the doctor cleared us to remain at home pending all other insurance approvals and various hurdles cleared. He'll complete the infusion on Friday night and we are hoping he keeps the typical fever side effect at bay so we don't wind up at the hospital for a late night antibiotic infusion. Then on Monday, Aug. 1st, William and I check back into UCSF for the 5 days of antibody therapy. This will complete round 4 of 5."

"WHY DID I END UP WRITING THIS BOOK AND TELLING THIS STORY? About four years ago I was bogged down in the revisions of a big novel set in Ghana and a friend suggested I write something set in Italy, something funny. I’ve not read many funny books and had hardly read any chick lit at all, but Emily set my wheels turning. I drove back to my place from hers – from Treviso to Albettone about an hour and a half on a white-hot summer morning – and by the time I reached home I had a title and a first line. I set myself up in the chicken shed next to house with my laptop and extension cord, so I couldn’t hear my kids. I wrote until it was too cold to stay outside and I think I was finished by winter. The title and the first line stayed the same. BREATHE WORKING WITH AN INDEPENDENT PUBLISHER AND HOW BLODDY HARD IT IS TO GET PUBLISHED IF YOU DON’T WRITE ABOUT VAMPIRES When I was young I assumed I would burst onto the literary scene and become another Simone de Beauvoir. It didn’t happen, as I told you. So I went to Africa and had babies. BREATHE When I came back to Europe nine years ago I took a while to get back to writing. A novel – even a bad novel – really takes YEARS to produce, then there are years of rejection, depression, divorces, kids, boyfriends AND SKIING LESSONS. When I finished The Divorced Lady’s Companion I thought it would be easier to publish women’s commercial than a literary work, BUT IT WAS JUST AS HARD! Many books in the chick lit category are written ABOUT thirty-year-old career women BY thirty-year-old women with careers. I read a few and couldn’t help thinking that there was a cut-off point in what was being published. There were less stories about over40s – which is when I think things get really challenging. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE TODDLERS START GETTING TATTOOS, what happens when you have wrinkles galore, and your prime is behind you rather than stretching out into the sunset? At one point I was thinking of the Eat Pray Love market without the praying and the self-analysis (I saw it in the aeroplane to Australia). I was convinced there would be an interest in an older woman’s story about teenagers, ex-husbands, new lovers and finding A DECENT WAY TO GROW OLDER without resorting to botox or finishing up on an ashram. BREATHE And so I submitted and submitted and submitted."

"I also need to think about who is physically fit enough to work long days in the African heat, and who is likely to get parental consent, especially with Kenya having some political problems and Embassy warnings. Many of our parents won’t let their children go to the Red Sea for example, because of media reports about problems Egypt, and we couldn’t include countries such as China or Greece because parents are afraid of the people in these countries, so there is a huge cultural minefield involved and that also needs to be taken into consideration, especially when many of our children and their families have never left Georgia before and they are already allowing their children to be away for two weeks, which is a big trust and responsibility for them. Plus we need to think about how they will cope on return from expedition, especially if they come from families where they have little money and not much food. This is in fact my biggest fear, as I know how hard it can be to fit back in after a life changing expedition, especially when others can’t relate to what you have experienced, and this is something I’ve also seen in soldiers coming back from war, as much as seeing it with explorers coming back from the Arctic or Amazon or whatever. So this is a huge factor, as is the children’s openness to new experiences and willingness to push themselves outside of their comfort zones. If they refuse to try local foods, and that is all that we have on offer, then they will quickly become ill or dehydrated and that could be disastrous, as much as them making a social or verbal faux par, as a wrong word could be taken massively out of context or misunderstood, even when not meant that way. For example, my calling a child ‘bossy’ would be no big deal in the UK, but calling a Georgian child the same word, would sound to a Georgian like ‘bosi’ meaning whore (long ago bosi actually meant beautiful, but not anymore). I have also heard the word ‘nigger’ being used for a black person in relation to its meaning in Russian coming from ‘negro’, but it would have an entirely different meaning outside of Georgia and could lead to massive problems for us. Just as Georgians use the word ‘I want’ rather than ‘I would like’ and often don’t include ‘please’ and ‘thank you’. This is not rude in Georgian culture, and is perfectly normal, but outside of Georgia could lead to our kids being seen as rude and demanding or impolite."
"When the the Highborne were exiled, they eventually settled in the Eastern Kingdoms, in an area now known as Tirisfal Glades in the then-Human kingdom of Lordaeron.

Soon after settling in Tirisfal, some of the Highborne slowly began to go mad, and those who yet retained their sanity realized the source of the Glade’s magical power was something truly evil. It is thought this evil magic is due to the presence of an Old God, imprisoned deep beneath Tirisfal."
"Born in Moneyglass, Co Antrim, Northern Ireland on May 4, 1974, 16-time champion A P (Tony) McCoy is the greatest jump jockey of his era and many would argue of all time. He is the son of Peadar McCoy, who bred the 1993 County Hurdle victor Thumbs Up. McCoy started out with Billy Rock, riding out from the age of 12, before trying his luck as a Flat jockey with Jim Bolger and rode his first winner on Legal Steps at Thurles on March 26, 1992. Since growing too heavy and turning to jump racing, he has not looked back. He partnered his first British winner, Chickabiddy, at Exeter on September 7, 1994 and was champion conditional rider in Britain in 1994/5 with a then record 74 winners when attached to Toby Balding’s Hampshire yard. He took his first senior title the following season with 174 wins. His domination has brought 16 consecutive jump jockey’s titles and he is currently well on course for number 17 this season. McCoy broke Peter Scudamore’s record of 221 wins in the 1997/8 season with 253 successes and broke his own record for the fastest 200 winners in the 1999/2000 season, ending up with 245 successes. In 2001/02 he beat by 20 the record of 269 winners in any season set by Flat jockey Sir Gordon Richards. He has passed the double century mark five times and reached the 3,000 winner mark at Plumpton in February, 2009. He had a fairytale 1997 Cheltenham Festival, recording a rare double on Make A Stand for his then boss Martin Pipe in the Champion Hurdle and Mr Mulligan in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. McCoy added a second Champion Hurdle when successful on Brave Inca in 2006 and a third in 2010 with Binocular. In total, he has partnered 27 winners at The Festival and won the Betfred Cheltenham Gold Cup for the second time in 2012 on Synchronised. In April, 2004, he left Martin Pipe’s stable after accepting a reportedly huge retainer from J P McManus and rides for the owner’s principal trainer in Britain, Jonjo O’Neill. He scored a long-awaited victory in the Grand National aboard Don’t Push It in 2010, his 15th ride in the race. That win helped towards him being crowned BBC Sports Personality of the Year that December. McCoy also rides regularly for Nicky Henderson. His wife Chanelle gave birth to their daughter Eve late in 2007. McCoy was made an MBE in the 2003 Queen’s Birthday Honours List and his achievements were recognised with a reception at Stormont, the seat of government in Northern Ireland, in August, 2009. In the 2010 Birthday Honours List he was made an OBE. John Smith’s Grand National Record: 1995 Chatam (Fell 12th), 1996 Deep Bramble (PU bef 2 out); 1998 Challenger Du Luc (Fell 1st); 1999"

"With the newly discovered trail the progress was good. By lunch time, whenever that was, we reached the same old watering hole. It was actually warm and sunny enough for people to dry closes and equipment and actually swim. Swimming is not a problem per se, even in that cold water. The problem is how to dry up after that. Some people swam in that whole. I didn’t. It wasn’t warm enough for my taste. But Venkad was swimming all the time. Perhaps different people have different levels of tolerance to not being showered. I didn’t mind. V have never swam (in all the trips I had with him I’ve never seen him swim). He did, however, shaved as soon as he had a chance."

"Thus with aerodynamics covered in some 23 pages, the text moves onto suspension and the expectation of detail on the RB5-6′s trademark pullrod rear suspension. After a summary of the purpose of an F1 cars suspension, Pages 58-59 have some fantastic CAD renderings of front suspension, uprights and hub layouts. However the rear suspension rendering stops short at the pull rod and no rocker, spring, damper layouts are detailed. Hardly a secret item, so lacking this detail is let down for a book announced as an RB6 workshop manual. A lesser point, but also highlighting the censorship of some fairly key technical designs, was the lack of any reference to Inerters (Inertia or J-Dampers), The suspension rendering simply pointing to the inerter and calls it the ‘heave spring’, while naming the actual heave spring damper as simply another ‘damper’. Inerters have been in F1 since 2006, predating Renault’s mass damper. Their design and purpose is well documented and shouldn’t be considered something that needs censoring. It’s also this section that fails to showcase the RB5-6 gearbox case. Instead using a pushrod suspended RB4 (2008) gearbox, albeit one made in carbon fibre."
"These soft, light, rolled out delicious cookies are fun to make not only because cookie cutters and colored sugars are used, but the two step or overnight process means the dough is prepared one day and refrigerated.

There are also other times during the year when my cookie cutters and my red/white rolling pin are located and used. However, before Christmas they are always used!"
"Levon Helm has a very different story. Levon is the real deal. He was a musician and songwriter who lived to create. He was the drummer for the Band, for which he sang songs which feel as though they had always been there. ‘The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down’, ‘Rag Mama Rag’ and ‘Up On Cripple Creek’ are timeless pieces of Americana. He didn’t care about commercial success. He wasn’t looking to be famous. He was the Everyman. He sang for all the nameless men who populated the American landscape from it’s very inception. You can hear Daniel Boone, Davy Crockett, Jesse James, Mark Twain, and James Dean in his voice. He managed to achieve that universality, that anonymous timeless quality that Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson aspired to but whose vivid personalities prevented. Levon Helm is a ghost. He was totally devoted to the music and evoking the spirit of America with his work. Levon Helm wanted to blend into the background and be remembered by other musicians. He could care less about anything more than that. He will be missed because the honest ones come along infrequently. Most artists are swayed by the star making machinery, and it affects their artistry, Levon Helm stayed true to his muse."

While we tried hard not to push her towards Elmo or anything else for that matter, one of her youtube videos has ducks and Elmo. And she has always loved her lift-the-flaps Elmo book.

"After having breakfast next to the creek, we packed up our gear and hit the trail. We took the Bright Angel trail out, which is longer than the Kaibab – over 9.5 miles (probably over 10 when you include our walk from the cabins to the official trail head) but less steep, so generally thought to be easier for the uphill journey. It also has more water along the way than the Kaibab – essential for a canyon hike, where the rangers recommend each person drink at least 2 liters on the way down and 2-3 on the way back up."

"It is at this point that we see the effects of such a delirious lifestyle. The final scenes of the film move at a lugubrious pace, providing a sobering respite to the preceding hysteria. They depict human beings as individuals in naked isolation, doing whatever we can to find a foothold what is essentially an indifferent universe. Bewildered old men wander alone amidst the crowds, searching for some sort of direction; firefighters sift through the remnants of a residential inferno, while paramedics assist a vagrant off the street and into an ambulance. Inside a hospital, an elderly patient limply beats her withered hand against her bed until a nurse takes heed of her call and clasps the woman's hand in her own. Such simple interactions are imbued with enormous pathos by Fricke's delicate framing and Glass's elegiac choral arrangement, and the film closes with an upward gaze: the footage of an Atlas rocket on an unmanned test flight. As the rocket soars through a perfectly blue sky, it slowly veers off-course, then explodes; the resultant cloud of debris plummets slowly back to the Earth. The self-destructive nature of human society could hardly be more eloquently stated than through the visual analogy of a flaming piece of shrapnel spiraling downward against a flawless backdrop, an image which freezes on the screen before dissolving into the same pictogram which opened the film. This transition from fiery destruction to ultimate renewal segues perfectly into the admonitions posited by the Hopi, the Native American tribe from which Koyaanisqatsi derived its title. The Hopi prophecies which provide the film with its coda prove to be wholly prescient, warning of the dire consequences which await those who allow their own hubris to supersede their reliance upon the Earth. It is a message which remains as urgent today as when Reggio first pleaded his case for a saner world almost three decades ago."

"Eating can be a challenging piece of it. You don’t want to offend Auntie Besty by declining her famous Pumpkin Cheesecake, but you also know that it will go directly to you hips (or spare tire). If you have the willpower to just have a bite or two (they say after 3 you don’t have the same experience anyway), go ahead and have those few bites. But if you know you can’t resist eating the whole slice (or TWO!), opt to slice a microscopic piece AND make sure to forgo the vanilla ice cream. Better yet, just have a bit or two off your sweetie’s! You shouldn’t completely forgo sweets during this fabulous season, but you also can’t eat every dessert that comes your way. You have to pick and choose what you want. Before you go to the party, decide on your priorities, would you rather have the hor’doreves or are you really in a dessert kind of mood? You really can’t have both. If there are 3 dessert options to choose from which one do you REALLY want or can you get itty bitty tastes of each?"

I didn’t ask him for his prayers for him; I asked for me. I asked him because I think that anyone who has gone through challenges like that must be very close to God. I asked him because I wanted his intercession.”"

They have 2 children so the kids had a good time while we had a good chat. Merry is lovely and it was a very relaxing visit. We left later than we expected and went to a great park in Burnside for lunch and a play before doing a cook’s tour of Dad’s places in Adelaide. We couldn’t go past PAC as the roads were closed for WOMADelaide but we went past his house, which was a nicer house and closer to the ABC building than I’d remembered. Auntie Bar’s original house at no. 17 was also a lovely old Adeliade-style house but no 1. looked dated and very run down but still with the same low mesh fence. We went past The Wilderness, which was very close by and then drove around the parklands (lovely and all labelled with Aboriginal names) past the river and the Adelaide Oval.

The refinery where he worked was slated to be shut down but it has been bought by a new company that has already started to refurbish and get it ready to reopen some time early next spring. Hubby is supposed to start back by October or November (it may be even sooner) so in the meantime, we are getting things done around the house and taking a few short trips. The refinery where he works is the only one on the east coast of the US that can process sour crude (crude oil from the Middle East) and I was sure it would never actually be shut down, but it was scary until it was announced in April that it had been sold! Yeah!! A lot of thanks goes to our great governor here in Delaware and his staff who worked tirelessly to get the deal done. They also were able to get a deal with Fisker Automotive to start producing electric cars in the old GM plant here in Delaware. All in all over 3000 people will be brought back to work thanks to their quick thinking and determination to get the state 'back to work'. Thank you, Governor Markell!!!!"

"The media landscape continues to shift as new technologies demand new business strategies, but one thing must remain constant during this transition period: credibility. We understand the company needs flexibility to make decisions quickly, and we have afforded the company that flexibility with a labor agreement that allows the company to change newsroom operations and reduce the workforce. However, the Guild has serious doubts that the decision by management to slash the ranks of copy editors will result in a more efficient newsgathering process. Instead, we believe it will result in a loss of credibility as more mistakes and errors appear in print and online."

"It would be nice if these styles took off as I think they open up so many new flavor palates. For this particular beer I had a very focused flavor profile I was going for. From previous experience with Brett Drie in my Best Bitter (almost a 1.5 yr ago), I know it produces some huge fruit flavors when young. Especially tropical flavors like guava, mango, papaya (think the popular Hawaiian drink POG). To follow-up with this, there are two main ways you can go with flavor blending - contrasting or complementing. I decided to go for something that would re-enforce the tropical fruit flavors - Nelson Sauvin hops. My first exposure to these hops was in Alpine Brewing's Nelson, which is wildly popular. My first time trying it, it took me by surprise because I was expecting a big citrus hop flavor typical of many West Coast IPAs and this beer has a soft fruit flavor. And at that point the \"Sauvin\" in the name started to make sense because of the relationship to white wine flavors."

I think about the fact that im 21 years old ... 21! I have a house a husband a really good job , but when it comes down to it, I have so much left to learn so many things to do still some days I wake up just excited about what the day holds... im just a kid and so was He.. that is the feeling that knocks my heart from my chest the feeling that he’s never going to get to do the things im doing, and He was gonna do so much, he had such a big heart He was bright and filled with life .always took care of me - he walked me to every class my freshman year . I wrote in my diary when I was 11 that nate was the first boy I ever loved , he was also the first boy who ever told me he loved me the funny thing was, I kissed him one time we were 13(took me a few years to work up the courage) and we both said YUCK YUCK never agian – I know right?? (Some friendships are just meant to be) but from that point on he was always there for me always by my side. when Tim and my mom used to fight we used to lay on the roof and watch the stars , he was the one who helped me move outof their house he always believed in me i moved out got a job and look at me know thanks to him.I thought I was so much braver than I am I don’t feel brave at all anymore."

And just as many generations have sung before them, they often sing about the joy, joy, joy, joy down in their hearts and about being happy, so very happy. The last verse of the song really gets them excited."

"I tried rolling just an inch or two on my head, and my neck hurt. I tried starting with my head almost flipped around so I wouldn’t have too far to go. I tried starting in a yoga tripod position (which I can’t really do, either). I couldn’t do it. Every time the crucial moment–when I had to flip my legs over–came, I started thinking about how this seemed really dangerous and my legs were a lot longer than they had been when I used to do somersaults. Couldn’t I really injure my neck, head, or legs, depending on how they flailed and where they landed? Did I want to end up in the ER simply because I was trying to do a trick not meant for adults? What was I trying to prove, anyway? There are some things that are only suitable for children, and that’s okay."

"All I can say in conclusion Flo is that all of this is the absolute truth. All of it. Let me add one last bit of info for you.

In the 13 marker test between Jes and I? Flo, we share 9 of 13 markers – that is only 2 above the threshold that could have made him my (birth) father. If you were to see the numbers between all of us? You’d know beyond a shadow of a doubt that all of this is true. I also asked Debbie to submit her DNA for testing. Ie: I wanted to see by what ratio she & I matched since she & I are known 1st cousins.

"So often Welles became his own worst enemy; no one wanted to work with him because he couldn't stop suggesting things, and then eventually suggesting so many things he tried to take over the picture. He did best when a good director and rest of cast was able to at least hold their own and not let his portly ego capsize the vessel. This might be the reason John Huston didn't cast him as Ahab in MOBY DICK, for example, but gave him one long sermon to cut loose in (as the preacher) then left him on the dock."
"Interviewing candidates after the hustings, they seemed to have been happy with the event. A comparatively low turnout could be blamed on a lack of PR for the event, and frankly, we’ve all got exams to be studying for, but it ensured that those students who actually came along were interested in the election. I’ll admit I was surprised at the lack of animosity between the candidates, particularly the Tory candidate, who was far from the baby-murdering monster that Tories are often portrayed as in the West of Scotland. He was actually pretty sound, although admittedly, knowing he’s going to get gubbed might do that. Fatalism can have a wonderfully calming effect on people."

Firstly such destruction created despair, which saw many industrial communities overwhelmed by Heroin addiction, and then later, almost its counterpoint, Ecstasy, and the raves that occupied the abandoned industrial spaces and represented new hedonistic communities for those deserted by the decline in old ways. Both these phenomena led to the ugly expansion of criminal gangs, now capable of making much higher profits through drugs, who now offer a seemingly easy route to money, power, status and belonging for those with few other opportunities, filling the vacuum in many communities left by the decline of previous power structures."

"Kim's women are endlessly stubborn and resigned, and they tend to stay that way throughout his narratives. His men are always looking for ways to \"purify\" them, to return them to a state of total submission. Note Yeong-ki's murder and subsequent burial of his daughter by a lake; it is there, in the tranquility of nature (itself a stand-in for regressive purity), that he can finally cease to worry about her threatening his control. Granted, the scene is \"only a dream\", but it seems a dream that Kim is waiting for to bleed into reality. In fact, the whole film is a dream, a dream of how Kim wants his society to be, with teenage girls always naked and homoerotic in their private time, men always searching for a quick way to assert their power, and families always disillusioned and criminalized without the grip of a father. Sure, he may disapprove of prostitution, but he is fond of a quieter, more invisible form of masculine domination. The simplest offense of all - and the area where Kim has been able to trick the international art cinema crowd - is that he's a clumsy, pedestrian filmmaker, cutting when he doesn't need to cut, punctuating when he doesn't need to punctuate, and aiming for emotions that miss the mark. If the audience is supposed to feel empathy when Yeong-ki's stuffs his face with sushi and subsequently throws it up to the tune of a sappy piano melody, something is severely off-kilter."

"Then, things happened and eventually our situation was brought to court. We had joint custody and it was horrible to leave Little One with him and then he tried to gain custody and get out of child support. He eventually said he didn't want to pay so I can just have custody. Wow. To hear that he doesn't even want anything to do with Little One or me was just so painful but I was glad because now we could move on and I haven't been happier since."

All I will say is that as far as I'm concerned, that act alone makes you an immeasurable bad parent! There is no excuse whatsoever for doing that, ever! All it ever does is put the children in the worst ever position and does absolutely nothing good for them, only for the parent doing the act. If you cannot control your emotions more than that, the person in question is incredibly immature. And nine times out of ten, it comes back and bites you in the arse in the future. It might be that the said children loose respect for you when they get older, or that they even go so far as to not want to see you much, and only when forced to."

"We decided to go with a saison yeast blend for this beer, which is the first time I have tried blending saison yeasts right off the bat. But both Paul and I have come up really frustrated with the Dupont yeast as a sole fermenter in the past, so this blend will be worth trying in a few beers. We decided to pitch both the \"Dupont\" strain and the \"French Saison\" strain, with twice as much Dupont yeast. The fermentation was started rather cool and ramped to 80 over a few days, a good compromise between the French strain which produces plenty of character at cooler temps, and the Dupont yeast which can't seem to finish out if it drops below 85 degrees. The French saison yeast will definitely help attenuate the beer faster when the Dupont yeast slows to a crawl in the last 1/3rd of fermentation."

If such organizations pursue an agenda of maximizing their membership, and hence their power and resources — as one would expect a rational, survival-oriented organization to do — then they will be susceptible of corruption, to the extent that they prove willing to endorse every version of social work that marches in the door. Without developing the thought further at the moment, one can expect that there is the profession of social work, with its do-gooder orientation (whether defined in lofty or realistic terms), and then there is the NASW; the interests of the two are not the same; and granting the NASW carte blanche to speak on behalf of the profession as a whole is potentially detrimental to those whom we claim to serve."

"From the distance of decades, in reading the memoir, what struck Genevieve most was Obama’s description of the gravity of that library, and the vast distance between their worlds, and his conviction that he alone was the one who knew how to live as an outsider.

"Around 400 BCE Aristotle in his Politics, went over the numerous kinds of government systems. (I’ll spare you a lot of Aristotle’s words because, as much as I love the man’s philosophy, what is left of his works has a style dryer than a stale cracker in the middle of the Gobi desert at noon…that and I’m planning a whole series of blogs on his Nicomachean Ethics to start in a month or so, so don’t think you’re getting out of this). The long and short of it is that he dislikes extremes. Rule by only the rich leads to corruption and misery. Rule by only the poor leads to stealing the wealth of the rich and anarchy. Rule by one person leads to tyranny and suffering. Rule by letting everyone vote (even if they’re criminals or non-citizens…I wonder who would be dumb enough to support something that insane?) leads to chaos and anarchy. Aristotle liked middle ground.* He liked the idea of a constitutional government, of a government of what he called aristocracy (we would call it a republic or representative government) and democracy, of where the law was higher than the whim of the ruling body (a set Constitution that is higher than the will of the mob) but not set in stone where it can never be changed (the process of amending that constitution). But of the things he goes over a lot is his distrust of the very rich and the very poor. He points out that whenever the concerns of either of these groups takes precedent it is the middle classes that suffer first followed by the entire government collapsing under the weight of corruption and chaos."

I suppose, instinctively, I knew this is one of those life changing moments in our lives, that I was leaving a place and a time I can never go back to. Because when I do go back, I would no longer be the same man. And people and friends would have changed and moved on with their lives.

"I love short fiction, I love the way stories are so diverse that there is something for almost everyone. I love the way they can be enjoyed in the small pockets of time in my life, snatched between breakfast and work, or at lunchtime, or on the bus or in a waiting room. I love that a small world is contained in only a few brief pages, and we can be taken out of our own world for a brief time, feel something might have changed, or learn something, feel something completely outside of ourselves. And with a good short story it can shake our roots, make us question, unsettle, amaze or make us laugh out loud. And we can carry a whole book load of these moments around with us, get the book out when we want an escape, find odd collections of these experiences inside one cover, but with themes and connections, or an overall journey, or patterns, that if we want to find them are hidden within the different stories."
"In the Band, lead vocals changed from song to song and sometimes within songs, and harmonies were elaborately communal. But particularly when lyrics turned to myths and tall tales of the American South — like “The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,” “Ophelia” and “Rag Mama Rag” — the lead went to Mr. Helm, with his Arkansas twang and a voice that could sound desperate, ornery and amused at the same time."

"In this episode, Arya meets Jaquen H’agar (yes I’m sure I spelled that wrong but I don’t care). He doesn’t appear to be important now, but trust me when I tell you that he will be of some importance to Arya later on down the road. For anyone who didn’t catch the implications in the first episode, they practically spell out for you the fact that while he lives, Gendry is the oldest child of Robert Baratheon and therefore, it could be argued is technically his heir and rightful King. I love the scene with Tyrion and Varys. The innuendo and intrigue is obvious to anyone with a brain, and so much the more so for the fact that Tyrion’s whore Shae seems so oblivious to the undercurrents. I enjoy their repartee very much. In the north, Sam saves one of Craster’s daughter-wives from Jon’s wolf Ghost, although he didn’t look particularly threatening to me, and now he wants Jon to help him save her and her child. His innocence should make him appealing, but it just makes the character even more pathetic. You’d expect him to get killed early on in his appearance in the cast, but Martin combines his naiveté with dumb luck and so Samwell Tarly is around for a long time. In the red waste Rakharo returns to his khaleesi…well his head anyway. It is so disheartening to us regular people that even bedraggled and with an unnatural, almost white head of hair, Emilia Clarke should look so gorgeous. Grr. Lord Baelish is a character that I came to dislike more and more as I read book after book and I can’t say that’s changing any when I watch the show. He’s cunning, cruel, slimy and has, so far as I can tell, absolutely no redeeming qualities. He actually makes Jaime Lannister look like one of the good guys. Ha! I was waiting for this. Janos Slynt gets his just desserts: he’s sent to the Wall by Tyrion. I wonder if Gendry and Arya both survive to the end of the story, will they end up together, ruling perhaps from Winterfell or King’s Landing? What? It could happen! I’m not looking to turn the series into a love story, but in the end, someone has to win the Game of Thrones. I don’t feel the least bit sorry for anything that happens to Theon. I really feel like he brings it on himself for being an entitled, whiney little brat. In the grand scheme, I think the House of the Kraken is pretty inconsequential. The TV Davos (loyal servant of Stannis Baratheon) is much more courtier than the book version of him. Not sure if I like it but I do love the actor playing him. His name is…Liam Cunningham. Hmm, I wonder how that might affect his character’s fate, if at all. Lena Headey (Cersei Lannister) does well with easy emotions like haughtiness and cruelty, but I can’t help wondering how she’ll do later on when – SPOILER ALERT! – she is brought low and must emote shame, regret etc. Guess we’ll find out. Although I will say, this is perhaps her best showing since The Jungle Book. Jon Snow you idiot! Have you learned nothing from your father’s death? Don’t try to save the boy! Honour will only get you killed….and there it is, the hit on the head. Isn’t it funny how even when we know it’s coming we root for the characters we want to succeed? Lucky for Jon, Martin has more for him to do before he’s done with him. Lucky for us."

"When you do a leash correction, make sure that you are not timid, anxious, nervous, or excited. As the leader, you need to be calm and assertive in your corrections or else your dog won’t take you seriously. If done correctly, with the right intensity and energy and timing, you should see your dog respond by lowering the head, looking at you, sitting down, or putting the ears back. A properly timed leash correction can change a dog’s behavior instantly and a smart dog needs only to be corrected in this way once or twice before getting the message that what they are doing is unacceptable behavior."

"There is no democratic government in the UK and the will of the people has been usurped by foreign interests whose sole intent is to radicalize the country so that it becomes subservient to the will of a foreign power i.e. the European Union of socialist states. Democracy cannot exist when the will of the people is ignored and when the elected government embraces foreign laws to the detriment of the majority of the electorate. Politicians supposedly looking after the interests of the British taxpayer are too busy reaping the rewards of being in office and as a result very few have the interest of the average Briton at heart."

"Europeans seem much more pragmatic than Americans, who are so idealistic. I feel much more optimistic about the future around Europeans because they seem to be generally more realistic about things: economic, social, cultural, whatever. But this can also lead to a kind of defeatism. Idealism is a quality that makes us Americans special; it’s what gave us the drive to achieve all the crazy awesome shit we’ve done. But Americans are now so idealistic about so many stupid, unrealistic things. It is also no longer positivist idealism, but a negative, destructive clinging to increasingly dogmatic ideals. In fact, the last person who said, “Yes we can,” has been vehemently opposed, attacked and undermined every step of the way. That is what commitment to ideals has become in America–a tunnel vision that is becoming ever more rigid, stubborn, unwilling and bitter. Most Americans spend a great deal of emotion and energy on socially conservative issues that don’t affect them personally while overlooking issues that actually do."

"When we got back, I was hungry and had lunch in an Italian restaurant (of which Copenhagen appears to have an abundance).

It essentially makes your life easier and a little clearer."
"Such a bias toward the status quo similarly infects our thinking and debate on space policy.

It’s what I have called the Apollo Cargo Cult — in too many minds, if we don’t have a really big rocket developed and operated by NASA, we don’t have a Real Space Program."

It's a shame that we don't get to hear more of his bebop recordings because later on Stuff really did kill dem strings. On some songs he's not that obvious while on some he get's even a solo or two. It's just so weird for me to hear a violin in a swing band among all those brass and wood instruments. Certainly worth checking out if you like big band music."

You get naked on a special bed covered in plastic and an attendant covers you in stuff, which could be mud or something fragrant of that consistency. Then you lay down and get covered by the plastic, which is warm. Then it inflates and you’re floating for upwards of 30 minutes in a warm mud bath while something like yoga music plays in the room. The room is dark and the attendant leaves you. You can fall asleep, and I have. I’ve also meditated. It is the closest thing I’ve ever experienced to being in a womb, minus that whole ‘breathing fluids’ part). It’s a treatment that’s available at our local spas, and it’s by far my favorite thing to do. I’m not sure if this is available in American spas, as I’ve never gone to a spa in the US… but if it’s not, then I’d definitely recommend it for when you happen to travel to Germany!"

Once, after introducing myself as St. Anthony's Advocacy Coordinator, I asked a group of high school aged volunteers if any of them knew what advocacy was. One young man raised his hand and said, \"isn't that when you, like, don't have sex, or something?\" I don't know if he was thinking of \"abstinence\" or \"celibacy\" - he surely wasn't thinking about advocacy."

"I like that even although they are dirty, they are old, they have been to loads of places, met a lot of people, have memories litterly on them (there's hot chocolate stains from an 'accident' in a cafe) they are still luminated. They can still shine brightly. Maybe not as bright as a brand new pair, but they are trying... and I like that my shoes still try and that they are still beautiful and wonderful even although they might be a little old."
"I do a variation of this salad at least three times a week. The best part is you can add or subtract about anything and it is still going to taste fabulous. I buy the huge bag of spinach at Costco and it lasts a week or two. It is also way easy to take to dinners or pot lucks."

"To further your education, Mr Cameron, you must understand that wars are fought between rival tribes, races and religions not in order to sate mankind’s desire for violence but as a means to an end, with the end being one thing and one thing only — political control over the defeated people. When you act against Britain’s Christians in the way that you now do, and lock up Englishmen who dare to portray Mohammed in posters, you are in effect enforcing sharia law against traditional Britain."
"As for the reaction of those in Congress, I am a little disturbed by the haughtiness of those who believe that they need more protection for themselves in the wake of this attack. I say if they can afford it, they should absolutely hire more security for themselves out of their own means, not that of the taxpayers. Otherwise, they can live under the same laws and in the same environment they have set up for the rest of us to live in. If DC is a gun-free zone, then those laws need to apply to them too. If their district does not allow for \"shall issue\" concealed carry permits, then they shouldn't have any special privileges for self protection either."

"This work might, therefore, be considered a supplemental or complementary treatment of various specifics of the overall topic, though many aspects previously dealt with in my other books will be presently touched upon, and this book has enough “new” subject matter to stand on its own right, apart from the others. The relationship of the Bible and Catholic doctrine is the greatest single emphasis of my own apologetic endeavors."
"Yesterday, at a house-warming party, I spent a long time talking to some of my friends in the Humboldt Permaculture Guild about various aspects of garden design, and the subject of peach trees on the coast came up. My friend Levon was talking about a consultation he’d done for a local resident’s orchard, and they had asked what to do about the problem of peach leaf curl. He said he told them the various ways to try to manage it, but the real answer was: “Cut down your peach trees and plant more plums.” Plums do great along the coast here, he pointed out, with little management or intervention, as do pears and apples. Why fight a constant (and probably losing) battle to keep your poor Frost peaches alive when there are plenty of fruit trees that thrive in this environment without our help?"
"In reality, if the publisher is operating on Net, you should ask for 16% (instead of 10%) for the first 5000 copies and then do the math from there on up. (Because 16% of $15 is $2.40 per book—pretty close on to the cover price royalty calculation.)"

I'm so glad I found it, as I think it's such a wonderful staple dress for both winter or autumn. The dense texture creates an interesting, three-dimensional surface in jewel blue tones, but the design itself is simple and practical enough to be worn for any occasion. It makes a nice change from all the black dresses I've hoarded over my mission to find *that* one-for-all-event LBD (which by the way, does not exist in singularity. I don't believe it.)"

Dr. King said that it will be at least 1 to 2 days before we get the results from the incision culture and the blood culture. If the infection is in the blood, we could be looking at months of serious antibiotics and a tougher bug to kill.

"Running in the early morning on the boardwalk is a great way to both get shots I would never otherwise encounter and satisfy my inability* to sit still for long. I even got a SpiBelt – the runner’s fanny pack – to carry my phone. I can now officially be described as an “active geek”, according to “Geeky,” the Spibelt reviewer. This is in contrast to the geek I saw on the beach with his tripod, sitting and waiting for the moment the sun crested the horizon. I, on the other hand, glanced to the left, paused briefly to withdraw phone, and got this shot. He may be able to mount his picture on the wall, but I still have proof I was there. And I got a workout in with a friend. Make that “social active geek.”"

Oh, and three, I never really had the guts to wear a bikini before. I was never really new to waxing (I wax my underarms all the time) but this one's different, of course."

"Mr. Hunch now makes his entrance. He needs to, because this is a very even matchup when all is read. But after all is said and done, the home field advantage is huge for San Francisco. The 49ers wouldn’t have stood much of a chance in my opinion if last week’s matchup had been held down in the Big Easy. And it’s back to The ‘Stick to decide who represents the NFC in Indianapolis, thanks in part to the Packers laying an egg last week. The weather won’t play a big factor (the heavy rains that pelted my house all of yesterday and last night have now passed on to leave only an occasional shower). But the fans, and the familiar comforts of home, coupled with the lack of a cross-country flight (that may aid the spread of the stomach flu throughout the Giants squad) will make the difference for San Francisco to make their sixth Super Bowl appearance."

"According to US One Direction's lawyer Peter Ross, Cowell’s company should have known better than to bring the UK band to America as One Direction, since he claims UK One Direction was made aware of the US One Direction when it attempted to file its US trade mark application. He is quoted in numerous sources as saying 'Rather than change their name or do anything to avoid confusion or avoid damage to our goodwill, they chose to press ahead and come on their tour'. As proof of the confusion, US One Direction pointed to a recent segment on NBC's Today Show where the UK One Direction was shown, but accompanied accidentally by music from the US One Direction."

This year, with our budget, we could not afford to do a big birthday and a big gift, both. So we gave Bubbs the choice of choosing one or the other. Let me clarify \"big\". A big party is what we have done just about every year. He always invites his whole class, plus other friends and family and we book a party somewhere, like at a skating rink, play palace, or something like that. It costs easily a couple hundred or more just for the party. For the \"big\" present, now that he is a little older, he wants cool gadgets, electronics, and video game systems for gifts. So we try to get him one big present and a few smaller ticket gifts."

"The big night came and the “holy” family paraded out, followed lastly by the guru himself, who then perched on the highest throne. Now I have told you all of this to get to this point. The crowd began to worship the guru and the other members of the family. At this point one of my band mates nudged me and told me to look at the family on their thrones. When I did this I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. They were there, but they had changed. They looked different. There were other entities that night that manifested on that stage and looking back now almost 40 years later, it is my opinion that what I saw was the demonic manifestation that in-dwelt each of these people."

"Feeling sure that what they sought was still ahead of them, the party arrived at the edge of the water. All was dark now that the staff had been removed. Elysia cast Fly and transported herself and Ferros across to the far side. They began their search of the cells where the demons had been imprisoned. There were huge scratches in the stone of the cells, marks of the frustration and anger that the demons had experienced during their centuries of imprisonment but no obvious signs of secret doors. Ferros’ Locate Object spell was still running, and he began to sense that it was nearby. Using triangulation, he pinpointed it about fifteen feet beyond the wall of the most left-hand cell. The wall seemed very solid indeed and it was likely that there was some other route to its location."

As if taxing is the only option, rather than smart cuts, intelligent regulation, efficiency, reduction of waste, and turning programs over to the states. No, Obama has only a vision of tax or no tax. No other option is available because he isn’t even concerned with justice or fairness."

"I am writing this at a time when Karachi is engulfed in violence. Just when we thought things were back to normal, and bodies laid to rest, there is news of shootings in Lyari, and an attack on a vehicle at Boat Basin. In the backdrop, there is a larger, duller violence. There is a strike every day -- paramedics for higher wages, people protesting lack of bijli, gas cuts, petrol price hikes, and mehngai. In rural areas, the poverty is so deep that without whole-scale governmental intervention, creation of livelihoods, investments in agriculture, there is no stopping the train of devastation. Instead, beguiling government officials and army walas sell farmland to foreign business, grant permission to the same to sell GMO seeds, and allow back breaking loans for mega projects. In cities there is a vile corporate takeover-- monstrous constructions of elite towers and malls, fully air-conditioned with glistening floors, are in full flow. Billboards outside my street are lit up by a generator guarded by a man in a van. Both funny and vulgar, it seems. In the meanwhile, a girl slips into coma after the light goes out at a government hospital and there is a lapse in her post surgical care. The elite, some of whom partake in the liberal activism, appease themselves, its about fueling the economy when they persist in hosting a top class fashion show -- but their real crime is not in not cancelling the show, but willful blindness to how bleak reality is for the rest of the people."

His mother baited him with questions and he acted dodgy at best but when he finally let the cat out of the bag, her heart sang in joy, she was glad, but she did not show it you see, she was Irish. She requested her son to bring over said woman, so that the woman could meet her. She had a few words of wisdom she knew she had to impart onto the couple. This she felt sure about, This was the fact that her son’s life had finally found meaning, had finally found purpose, and how long she had wished this for him, well silently of course, she did not want the husband finding out that she entertained fantasies of bliss in her head, that would be fool hardy."

"Does this mean he doesn’t believe at all in the value of economic growth? No, the president’s new appointee is not trying to eliminate economic growth from the equation, as he also believes that “sustained increases in national income – that is, economic growth – are required for poverty reduction.” Relying on previous research, he argues that countries that made crucial developments in poverty reduction and human development have also “done quite well in securing long-term economic growth.”"

"The shrinkage in Irish household sizes is to be expected and furthermore is in line with realities in the rest of Europe. According to Eurostat, in 2009 the average EU household size was 2.4. This hides a large variation with Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus and Malta having 2.9 and at the other end of the spectrum Germany, Denmark and Sweden with just 2.0. Eurostat reported that we had a 2.7 average size here in 2009. It seems though that the long term trend for all countries is average household size is reducing. In 1971 in the UK there were 2.9 people per household with one person households accounting for 18% of households. In 2009 that had fallen to 2.4 per household and one person households accounted for 29% of households. And as forIreland, here’s a table setting out our population, number of households, household size and % of households having a single occupant since the first census in the State in 1926."

It's a town of bottom feeders all convinced they're the next Brando or Meryl Streep or (God help us) the next Orlando Bloom or somebody, and they're fully prepared to kill — be it relationships or friendships or their own dignity — to keep the shards of their increasingly cracked illusions from hitting the floor around them."

Hours later I came in to get cleaned up thinking I would join friends and festivities at the local Irishman's Pub. As I was toweling my hair dry I turned on the tv and realized they were calling \"Jockeys up!\". No way could I get hair, make-up, clothing and driving to the pub done in a few minutes.

Now, however, you don’t get that and I miss it. (But we all know American Healthcare is in the fucking toilet so I guess I’m just beating an already dead horse (excuse the metaphor) on that one.) While I do eventually want to be a Psychologist, I think it would be better if I was with an actual Psychiatrist for the entire time and I would like him, or her, to do the talk therapy with me so he can try to figure out what it is I really need without fucking guessing. Sometimes people just need talk therapy, which I know is part of what I need, but I also need actual medicine because there is a chemical imbalance which is causing me to have some of the thoughts and feelings I’m having and I would really like one person to take care of all of this!"

These families are fighting just as hard as we are, even with the deck stacked against them in one way or another, because what else can they do?

Here we are, almost 5 months into our South Korea experience and I still haven’t created the elaborate blog I thought I would be enticed to create. In fact, I haven’t done too many things that I ‘thought’ I would be doing. As I look back at my first post I wonder if maybe that’s a pleasant symptom of living in the moment.

"These three points I have wanted to mention. I am sure of them from the Koran of the Turks. What I have heard beside I will not bring forward, because I cannot be sure about it. Suppose, then, that there are some Christians among the Turks; suppose that some of them are monks; suppose that some are honorable laymen; even then, what good can there be in the government and the whole Turkish way of life, when according to their Koran these three things rule among them; namely, lying, murder, and disregard of marriage, and besides, everyone must keep Christian truth quiet and dare not rebuke or try to reform these three points, but must look on and consent to them, as I fear, at least so far as to be silent? How can there be a more horrible, dangerous, terrible imprisonment than a life under such a government? Lies destroy the spiritual estate, murder the temporal, disregard of marriage the estate of matrimony. Now take out of the world veram religionem, veram politiam, veram oeconomiam, i.e., true spiritual life, true temporal government, and true conduct of the home; what is left in the world, but flesh, world and devil?

If one single molecule in this fabulously complex structure were to disappear, or become defective, the flagellum would neither work nor be of any use to the bacterium. The flagellum must have been working perfectly from the first moment of its existence. This fact again reveals the nonsense in the theory of evolution’s assertion of “step by step development.” In fact, not one evolutionary biologist has so far succeeded in explaining the origin of the bacterial flagellum although a few tried to do so."

You even pick the place you want the book to go! The books are right there in front of you, fully illustrated, click to turn the page and when you finish a book is donated. Even without the free muffins and coffee I would be excited about this."

"The first activity features a short clip from Saturday Night Live that you may have seen called “La Policía Mexicana.” By now the students have learned almost all the words in the video, and in the video they say “no sé” several times. It is also a pretty entertaining skit that pokes some fun at how Spanish classes typically operate. I am hoping the students will feel good about how much Spanish they know from the video. As an extension activity, I could have students make a similar skit on their own, or give them the outline of the original skit and have them change the details."

"For the next month, you are best served by playing it low key, lying in the weeds, working behind the scenes or working alone. That's because your birthday is a month away, and so you are waiting in the wings right now. Factoid. However, it also makes this an ideal time to strategize what you want your new year (birthday to birthday) to be all about. You have four weeks to think about this. Aside from the obvious deadlines of work, I generally just let life happen to me. But sometimes, I grab it by the tail, I nail it down, I give myself objectives with timetables, and I'm shocked at how much more I get done! (Can't hurt to try it.) After all, life is short -- and fat."

"A new band with the previously featured Greg Cee on the roster. Much like the solo work of Greg Cee, this band plays loud and howling garage punk. At risk of saying so about too band submitted bands, they remind me of the early Ty Segall bands like Party Fowl and Epsilons. But I just as easily might say Tyvek or Nohopekids. Hope they realize how happy I am to get some garage sent in, been hankering it all the more since some conversations with people that are less than fans of the genre."

Perhaps the worst moment of his presidency was turning his back on the Iranian anti-government demonstrators in 2009, who chanted “Obama, are you with us or with the regime?” Obama’s silence was a historic missed opportunity. So is his current inaction on Syria, Iran’s most important ally. There appears to be no strategic coherence in his Middle East policy. Why, for example, help bring down Qaddafi, as odious as he was, after he had abandoned his nuclear program and his support of terrorism—while allowing Assad a free hand?"

"Let's face it...the poor kid has me for a mother. Which sadly means I gave her a fucked-up name that she'll forever be pronouncing and spelling for people (but seriously, she's growing up in world where people take the perfectly good name Aidan and spell it Aiydenn, so...at least hers is a real name. Spelled right). And it also means that until she can dress herself, I get to dress her. Which means no sparkly pink t-shirts proclaiming that she's a spoiled brat or that she's the boss or even that she's a pretty princess. A good chunk of her clothes are clothes I would wear, and that means they skew more gender neutral and classic. She has beautiful dresses, trust me. And I can't wait to put her in them. But they are more A and less B. There's nothing wrong with B...it's just not my style. And also she'll probably grow up to be a stripper. But mostly nothing wrong with it. If you want to raise a stripper. (KIDDING, please don't hate me if you love that style.)"

"Your sleep schedule is an important aspect of healthy sleep. Going to bed each night at similar times helps the body to establish a pattern and subconsciously know when to wind down each day. It won’t hurt you to stay up late for a night or two, but continually staying up for hours or even all night can reverse your schedule and confuse your body."
"In a section of the Sermon on the Mount in which Jesus challenges us to engage systems of domination with creative nonviolence, he offers this final, perhaps most radical, word, “Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one who would borrow from you” (Mt 5:42). This verse challenges our most precious possession, control. When faced with how to best use our resources, this verse challenges our addiction to those resources and the power and privilege of deciding how they are used. Elsewhere, Jesus tells the rich young man that following him requires divesting himself of all his possessions and give to the poor, enacting Jubilee in his own life (Mt 19:16-22; Lk 18:18-30). There is a radical principle here summed up in the Psalms and the Jubilee in Leviticus 25 that God is the only absolute owner. Followers of Jesus are called to hold their possessions loosely as things to be used for God’s purposes and not their own accumulation or comfort."

Heads up: Noel hates Man United. He’s a City fan. But I digress…"
"The other advantage to whipping up your own hummus is the price. A small tub of store-bought hummus easily goes for $5. Your own? Much less. The priciest item is the jar of tahini, which lasts for many batches. The other items—lemon, canned or dried garbanzo beans, hot sauce, garlic—are quite economical. Homemade hummus can be tweaked to your preferences. Like it chunky? Go easy on the food processor. Silky smooth? Add more liquid and blend away. Spicy? More Tabasco. Enough garlic to ward off the Twilight trilogy? Add a few cloves. You get the idea."

"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, by Jared Diamond: he “employs the comparative method to understand societal collapses to which environmental problems contribute.” He lists 12 environmental problems facing mankind today. The first eight have historically contributed to the collapse of past societies: (1) Deforestation and habitat destruction; (2) Soil problems (erosion, salinization, and soil fertility losses); (3) Water management problems (4) Overhunting; (5) Overfishing; (6) Effects of introduced species on native species; (7) Overpopulation; (8) Increased per-capita impact of people. The root problem in all but one of Diamond's factors leading to collapse is overpopulation relative to the practicable (as opposed to the ideal theoretical) carrying capacity of the environment."

(I am also aware of a case where this occurred after a man drank a bottle of red wine having also taken over-the-counter medication to assist him to stop smoking – the two things produced a chemical effect which made him present to police officers as if he were mentally ill. The MHA assessment team agree and detained him s2 MHA.)"

It all sounded easy to me, although a bit like shopping on Ebay and about as romantic!"
"By all accounts Clift and Monroe were both half out of their minds on booze and pills during the torturously long location shoot and the wild vulnerability they display is probably not all acting. They'd both be ground up before you know it, just like the scores of mustangs that used to be out in these mountains. And the cowboys will be thrown up against the barb wire and neon of the west they've won, and lament there's no more hosses to rope. They've all been turned into dog food and the dogs that ate the food are all dead from old age and there you are. Mustangs gone as if they'd never been. That's progress, like the westward expansion that reaped the dust bowl. The whole final segment of roping the mustangs and Marilyn Monroe freaking out with those big doe eyes running the bi-polar gamut is so painful I had to walk away from it, keep it running on the DVR and came back for that brilliant final fade-out, with Gable and Monroe driving 'home' - wherever that is. No credits, no music, no... nothing. It's not perfect as a film but as death's desert Christmas card it's ripe with transcendental mythic inscrutability and that alone makes THE MISFITS a quiet, drunken, desperate little triumph. Set it free, set them all free, like Monroe and Clift and Gable are free, and play God here tonight."

People drive to gas stations to buy gas, sure, but they also drive to Beer Super to buy beer. Are the gasoline fumes going to drive them to drink to excess on the way home? There's nothing about buying gas that makes people more likely to drink. Is it the \"ice-cold sixpack\" \"waved in their face\" that Shipula brings up that's the problem at the gas station? Funny, because he also lauds people buying six-packs at Pennsylvania's restaurants and bars, most of which they're driving away with, judging by the parking lots at so many of them.

"How did India begin is bonhomie with these rich sports? A lot of it has to do with British. How is it that India took Cricket so seriously and left out Rugby and Soccer? One word answer to that question would be ‘Fitness’!!! One look at the list and we can see that apart from Tennis and to some extend F1, none of the above sports demand astute physical fitness. Apart from Tennis, the other sports are played in a handful of countries. In other words, India has done well where there is less competition and requires less physical fitness. India is nowhere near the world’s most popular sports – Soccer, Athletics, Aquatics, Hockey, Basketball, Rugby, Volleyball, etc. Cricket is the only popular sport where we win matches regularly. It is followed and played by a lot of people but very few countries actively play the game."

Without knowing it, I decided I would parent this way a long time before I had children, never knowing it was actually considered ‘attachment parenting.’ I believe in this way of behaving towards my children because it feels right to me and I cannot imagine going about this journey in any other manner. I look forward to the adults my children will become, knowing that the groundwork I lay here and now will not only benefit them and myself but everyone who chooses to walk in and out of their lives."

But walking will be my baseline, keep the exercise habit going, and remind me that this is who I am. Someone who trains no matter what."

This pale ale pours with a quick head and very little beading. The taste is both bitter hoppy and sweet, which must hint at some sort of careful balance that my uninitiated palate is incapable of picking up. It’s also vaguely nutty with low carbonation. Bottom line: Peg Leg Pale Ale is a good one and a decent example of the style."

The only place I really felt like I belonged was on the football team, but even then, my tendency to read books in excess of 1,000 pages before, after, and sometimes during practice set me apart from my teammates. I rarely dated, though that trend continued even into my adulthood. I became used to being described as weird.

While I think I’ll definitely try and take on Ulysses in the future (famous last words), I don’t think I’ll revisit Dubliners unless it’s to revisit “The Dead”, which really manages to drive the point of the entire collection home poignantly. I will say that Joyce, naturally, has an amazing sense of place and giving the reader the right detail to orient themselves in Dublin; it’s part of that unflattering reflection into the world and making these characters real people. I may not want to come back and visit, but it’s still firmly a place on my literary map of the world."

"First, mix together your milk and lemon in a glass bowl to sit and culture for at least 10 minutes. Then in a different large mixing bowl mix together your dry ingredients and then cut in the oil and butter like you would a pie crust recipe. Lastly, add the milk mixture and stir well. It will be a bit foamy and wet when you first mix it all together. So let the batter sit for 10-15 minutes for the oats to soak up the moisture. Then these biscuits are a \"drop\" biscuit recipe- so you will use a 1/4 cup measuring cup to pour out and drop the batter on a parchment papered baking sheet. Then top the biscuits with a sprinkle of orange zest. This recipe will make 1 dozen large biscuits, or 18 smaller biscuits. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 18-20 minutes. Until golden brown and stiff. Pull from oven and let cool for a few minutes before moving and serving."

"At the cliff end, the land plummets down to the town. One possible means of descent, the East Hill Cliff Railway, has ceased running for the day which leaves me with the only other option: a steep flight of stairs, the treads of which are too wide and the risers too low to comfortably descend with any sort of rhythm. Sneaking along the back of houses, through narrow gaps between the tall, thin buildings, the stairs emerge at the Stade, home to Europe’s largest beach-launched fishing fleet. The black-weatherboarded net shops, like tall sentry boxes, could, I suppose, be described as quaint, attracting the tourists as they do, but this is still very much a working beach. I scrunch across the shingle, weaving between the weatherbeaten boats and rusting winches and bulldozers that drag the fleet up the beach, past tangled webs of nets, and stacks of battered brightly coloured fish boxes."

"Concentration on the present, which gives the title to the book of interviews of Hadot’s entitled The Present Alone is our Happiness, helps us to see that it is the ‘thickness’ of the present, which is to say, the presence within it of the past and future, which are the cause of most of our suffering. Worries about the future, regrets about the past, these pulls yank us out of the present, divert our focus on where we are right here and now. But for Hadot, and many Ancient schools before him, the present has all we need to be happy. Hadot particularly emphasizes the way this played out in “Stoic virtue” and “Epicurean joy.” As will become clear, the second and third exersices flow naturally from this first, and in different flavors for Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Buddhism, in ways I’ll address now in turn."

"This team will certainly cause its first-round opponent some headaches with its depth and blistering pace of play.

Fast forward to yesterday morning when he woke up and just looked very sickly. After me being up all night with breathing treatments and Tylenol/Motrin to keep his fever away...as not to cause a seizure...the wheeze was still there. I called and they got him right in for a chest x-ray and office visit. In the office, he was pulse ox-ing the very low 90's...when the doctor listened to his lungs, he wasn't moving any air at all. At that time, they ordered back to back to back albuterol treatments...7 total and he was still stating very low and having a hard time breathing. They decided to admit him to the pediatric intensive care unit where they can keep a better eye on his lungs. He, at that point, was put on 2 liters of oxygen...and he was STILL pulse ox-ing in the low to mid 90's. The flood of memories and emotions hit me like a tsunami....to.much.to.take.in. Why? After all of the struggles he has been through...why does he have to battle massive lung issues that could kill him. I lost nick to bad lungs and I really thought we were out of the woods with Kenny...but I guess this will always be an issue."

"The iPad measured at 6.2% lower reading speed than the printed book, whereas the Kindle10.7% slower than print. However, the difference between the two devices was not statistically significant because of the data's fairly high variability. Thus, the only fair conclusion is that we can't say for sure which device offers the fastest reading speed. In any case, the difference would be so small that it wouldn't be a reason to buy one over the other. Speed is something we hadn't really thought about and don't have a ready answer for why this might be. It may be familiarity; perhaps once people are as used to e-reading as they are to print, these numbers might even out."

As a matter of fact I thought that the lead organization of the sport in this country was already collecting this data on our coaches. I think that would be a tremendous aid in working towards the “30 medal goal” in major championships. Such a collection of data would be very useful in trying to match up athletes on the brink of success with coaches that possibly might be able to help them get “over the hump”.

"The story repeats in German clothing stores, book stores, postal offices, banks, etc. It’s no wonder many Americans perceive German salespeople as a bit cold. They just don’t share in our mentality that pseudo-friendless equals an improved customer experience (which is debatable conclusion in itself, I might add). On the other side, it’s no wonder that many Germans are turned off by chatterbox salespeople in the U.S. They’re just not used to someone “pestering” them as soon as they step foot in a store."

"Our flying record isn't great. We had not flown since 2005. We were trying to book a holiday, abroad, in 2006 around the time that the terrorist bomb plot to blow up airlines, flying between Heathrow and the US, using liquid explosives, was discovered, which resulted in the current liquid restrictions. At the time there was so much uncertainty that we decided to holiday in the UK, avoiding the need for flying.

Different rabbits, like different dogs or different cats or different humans, have different styles. Some are boisterous and wild, some are quiet and calm. Nessie tends toward the calm and quiet...but....she has a major temper and doesn't flinch at letting you know when she is displeased. Having a bunny give you the squinty stink-eye is sort of intimidating, having a bunny rip out with a full loud growl when lunging toward you is startling and scary. Nope, she is not a shrinking violet...just a fairly quiet one. And we are honored (pretty much) that this quiet one graces us with her presence. :-)"

"Sure, you could argue that this is progressive for Syria or the Middle East and maybe it is in some ways, but (a) Syria is highly unrepresentative of the Islamic Middle East, (b) the film was unrepresentative of Syria, and (c) the film was definitely being sold as a reflection of Islam as a whole, not just Islam as it is practiced in the region, and it just serves to reinforce the stereotype of Islam being behind the times. Our very existence in Southeast Asia counters this. And while the heart of the Islamic world lies in the Middle East, you can’t brush us off because we matter: Indonesia alone is the world’s largest Muslim country."

All you can drink promotions and speed drinking competitions will be banned from April, and pubs required to provide free tap water, while from October smaller measures of beer, wine and spirits must be offered and any customers appearing to be under 18 must be asked for identification. Now, I’m not going to rush to the barricades to defend all you can drink promotions, but it is naïve to think that well-run pubs have nothing to fear from this. Taken as a whole, these measures represent an unprecedented degree of interference in the way licensed premises are run, which will impose new burdens on responsible and irresponsible licensees alike."

"Vogel believes that William is at fault because his reckless driving resulted in someone being killed. He disregards the meeting William had with the victim's family, since it bears no relevance to the crime that took place, but he does say that whatever conditions the victim was under at the time of the accident are also of no relevance because William's bad driving history is the real issue. Taking William's youth into account, Vogel sentences him to one year's imprisonement at hard labor and a fine of $5,000. He sets bail and a stay of execution, and orders him to turn himself in to the sheriff of Cook County at 10:00 on the morning of Saturday, the 16th."

Try adding carrying my massage table and supplies up and down multiple flights of stairs and the exhaustion is two fold. I count my blessings that I have a growing number of private clients who prefer massage in their homes, but there are some days where I wonder if I can really keep doing this. While I was in school, I had purchased my first massage table to use at home for practice and eventually, private in call clientele. The table weight is about 42 lbs. With bolsters and supplies, I would fairly estimate the massage luggage to be around 46 lbs. This is the table that I have carried up 5 flights of stairs, precariously balanced on one shoulder while hailing a city cab and dragged into the narrowest of living rooms to perform what I can only describe as “ninja” massage for the contorted positions I had to take in order to do my work.

They are licensed through a national certifying exam and accredited by the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant. They can perform examinations, diagnosis, treatments, and have prescriptive authority. To maintain their licenses, PA’s must undergo 100 hours of continuing education every two years, and recertify by exam every six years. To maintain their licenses, PA’s must undergo 100 hours of continuing education every two years and recertify, by exam, every six. While they work in association with physicians, they are not independent practitioners. Unlike physicians, PA’s cannot specialize and have no specialty boards. They work alongside MD’s in an autonomous relationship, which includes ordering tests, interpreting tests, and prescribing. They can staff clinics, assist in surgery, and work on call for the practice. PA’s can treat most primary care illnesses on their own, which means that they are responsible for the diagnosis and treatment options, they also do perform follow up examinations when necessary."

Should we reduce costs, and therefore price at the bar, by adding cheaper sugar and have a beer that is thiner and with less body, but a bit cheaper? Perhaps you think we should stick to our principles?"
"I was using my 16-35mm wide-angle lens, usually a no-no for portraiture, as it tends to distort features unnaturally (especially up-close, where it can make noses bloom and hairlines recede). However in this instance, I kept really close to the rock but not so close to my subject, A., who stayed in the middle distance (which for that lens is about 5-10 feet away). The effect was to keep A. fairly well proportioned, but blow the rock right out, filling the frame, stretching it and (at closest range) blurring it. Oddly, this actually gave the impression of movement through the image, and making the frozen twists and boils of the rock appear fluid, another nice contrast. With A.’s hair catching a sniff of sea breeze, it gave an overall impression of motion and dynamism to an otherwise static scene- almost like a breaking wave frozen in time."

Set in post-Revolutionary America in the hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, near the Dutch-settled village of Tarry Town, New York, the story concerns Ichabod Crane, a tall, gawky, superstitious schoolmaster who is smitten with Katrina Van Tassel, the prettiest girl from the wealthiest family.

I was about to say, not particularly inspiring, but then I realised that I have used bits of the town, the cafes, shops, the streets, the parks, river, houses, etc. etc. in my books. My latest, This Is Not Forgiveness, is set in a town very like it, not exactly the same, of course, I would find that too restricting, but not dissimilar. It's an unexceptional town, where ordinary people live, so if you are writing a book about ordinary people, I guess it helps to live and write about somewhere that is easily recognisable, ubiquitous even. That's what I tell myself, anyway."

"Chris's mom expected him to study hard, go to college, be a doctor or a lawyer. I tease him that he didn't become a lawyer; he married one instead. His partner, Bill, is an attorney in Washington, DC, and if that wasn't scary enough to me, he's also white. And Republican. Yikes! White Men in Suits! Republicans in DC! I was prepared not to like him very much, but, as it so often goes with our narrow-minded stereotypes, I had to completely change my mind as soon as I met Bill. He's a totally nice guy, funny and charming, completely supportive of Chris and his work in the way that makes you believe the whole leftt-brained needs right-brained way: I think sometimes people with really left-brained kinds of careers really benefit when they have someone whose work is at the other end of the spectrum. It's kind of simplistic to put it that way, but if you're spending your days around people who are maybe kind of analytical in their approach to things, I think it's got to be so calming to come home to another kind of thinking. And vice versa, of course. Their home is filled with wonderful art--it's like a gallery, and you keep seeing things you missed the first time around."

"Ice sheets covered the sidewalks making the task of walking harder than it should have been. Belinda barely felt the chill as walked the few blocks down towards the bus stop. The smell from the fresh baked goods, courtesy of the bakery across the street, floated gently on winter winds, wafting around her body and settling into her nostrils. Her stomach rumbled loudly and a passerby stopped to stare at her as he walked by. She could have sworn that you could hear the knots in her stomach form. Belinda hated it when people stared at her. Every time she left the house lately she’d been getting more and more anxious. It felt like more and more people stopped to gawk at her lately. She could feel their eyes upon her skin and it gave her the heebie jeebies. Belinda wished she would have remembered to eat breakfast this morning. Then maybe that stranger wouldn’t be staring at her right now. Forgetting about the stranger and focusing in on her hunger pang, she was absolutely ravenous suddenly. Belinda tried to recall the last time she had ate something and came up blank. She still had five minutes to spare before the bus came. Belinda let her stomach guide her to the closest morsels of food. Following her nose across the street to the bakery while she convinced herself she had the time and wouldn’t miss the bus if she stopped and ate. Soon she found herself sitting in a corner by herself and ignored life for a few moments while she got lost in her coffee and bagel. Her hunger successfully sedated for the time being she felt better. Belinda grabbed up her book bag and slurped down the last drips of coffee before heading back on track to catch the bus."

"The core problem is that scientific research was necessary, but not sufficient, to create today’s industrial societies. Cheap abundant energy was also necessary, and was arguably the key factor. In a very real sense, the role of science from the middle years of the nineteenth century on was basically figuring out new ways to use the torrents of energy that came surging out of wells and mines to power history’s most extravagant boom. Lacking all that energy, the technological revolutions of the last few centuries very likely wouldn’t have happened at all; the steam turbine, remember, was known to the Romans, who did nothing with it because all the fuel they knew about was committed to other uses. Since the sources of fuel we’ll have after fossil fuels finish depleting are pretty much the same as the ones the Romans had, and we can also expect plenty of pressing needs for the energy sources that remain, it takes an essentially religious faith in the inevitability of progress to believe that another wave of technological innovation is right around the corner."

We read many passages such as Psalm 134-135 & John 16:1-15, which were very inspiring, until the sun was finally engulfed by the horizon. We walked back to the camp and finished up with cooking hotdogs and playing Grog (a very fun, yet terrifying game)."

"Personal injury, whether caused by a motoring accident or otherwise, will continue to happen and the victim will still need good legal representation to make the claim for compensation. For a large number of law firms, following a ban on referral fees, the problem of visibility to potential clients will become an even more serious problem unless they develop their profile on the web and other media to put their expertise and services before the potential client. Most people do not routinely have a ‘family solicitor’ and may well have had no cause to consult a solicitor before an accident happens. When an injury occurs they will, inevitably, seek advice on a local solicitor or search google. Some larger law firms and the new breed of legal services provider will have the budgets for television and other media advertising and will dominate the media, however most may not even get a nibble if they aren’t on the first page of google?"

Someone I care about deeply sent me a text message asking me about the night terrors I used to have, and what I did about them. She is my sister, and she is about the same age now as I was when I was having them. We talked on the phone a little bit and I listened to the things that she was experiencing, and gave her the advice she was looking for. Then I had not one, but two counseling appointments. The first involved me talking about what is important to me – what gives me a sense of identity – and going through the most painful of my symptoms to assess which areas would be most beneficial to me to receive help in. The second involved lengthy discussions and dissections of family patterns, and I left that feeling loopy. By the time I got home I was in a full-blown rage, shutting out the world."

HBO doesn’t give you easy-to-digest comedies; they give you series that take more time to work out. Take the series that occupied this timeslot last week, Eastbound & Down – it was a comedy series I was initially put off by but the more time I put into understanding that world and getting to know those characters the more I got out of it because I better understood what the show was trying to do. This is, of course, rather obvious stuff – certain comedy voices take more time to understand than others – but that’s how I feel about Veep; this is a clever comedy but it’s one that needs more time before I completely give myself over to its way of thinking."

"But then, I didn't really have time to stick around for a Q&A, because I was off to Kirby Dick's (THIS FILM IS NOT YET RATED, TWIST OF FAITH) new film, THE INVISIBLE WAR. Right to the point, it's about rape in the military. And Kirby gets right in there and interviews the victims, bringing painful personal stories to light. And he backs it up with statistics, all of which come from government reports. About 20% of women serving in the military have been assaulted at some time (a smaller percentage, but larger total number of men are also assaulted.) New recruits into the military are twice as likely to have committed or attempted rape than the corresponding demographics in the civilian population. And most upsetting is how rarely anything is done about it. Since you don't report to an outside police force but to your chain of command, often the victim has to report the assault to either a friend of her attacker or sometimes (bizarrely) to her attacker himself--and then he gets to decide whether to investigate."
"and here's my interpretation ofher sketch, using Dreamweaver's Asian \"Love\" stencil as my sentiment, with glossy blue embossing paste and Navajo Sky Metallic FX. First, stamped the Impression Obsession image with clear embossing powder on glossy cardstock, then dipped it onto a Non Stick Craft Sheet which I'd sprayed with blue and green Ecoline Inks mixed with water and Winsor and Newton Iridescent Medium mixed in a Ranger Mini Mister. Then I paste embossed the stencil with the blue glossy embossing paste (again on glossy cardstock), removed the stencil, let it dry, then repositioned it and pounced Metallic FX over dabbed-on glue. I really like the sheen that the Metallic FX gives over the blue glossy paste. I cut that with a Spellbinders plain circle die, then mounted it over a blue panel cut with the same die, and white cardstock cut with a Spellbinders Lacey Circles die. I used some gold peel-offs for the corner embellishments. This card is in the post, along with a hand crafted Christmas present, to a long time, dear lady friend, who loves blue and white!"

"You definitely do (or try to do) everything that Brylee is doing and it goes well most of the time. You sleep from 730 at night to 7:30 in the morning and you take one nap during the day. You are a very good eater....you will eat anything. You are still drinking soy milk and you will do that for a while since you are allergic to regular milk."

"I think it’s probably a combination. The economy could be driving people to order from the counterfeit websites with the hope that they will get “the dress” they want for much less. Our employees are reporting that they are talking to many customers on the phone and in the store who are either planning to order from a knock off site or already have and couldn’t wear the dress they were shipped,” according to sources."
"On a beautiful Saturday afternoon at one of my favorite Mexican restaurants Peso’s Mexican Cantina, I was able to meet with the very eccentric Londyn Lyná. Meeting her I was able to see the fun loving spirit within her; I even got her to do her British accent!! This 24 year old artist representing Atlanta, GA is the most down to earth person that you will ever meet. Not only does she sing but she also plays the piano and clarinet. Her background in music is derived from a spiritual one, she is also inspired and reflective of Erykah Badu, Amy Winehouse, Sade, Ella Fitzgerald, and Count Basie just to name a few. “I love composer and pianist Richard Smallwood, I like a lot of old jazz. I make classical music with a contemporary sound.” When I asked Ms. Lyná what type of people she surrounds herself with she responded, “I surround myself with people like myself. I realize all of my friends that I hang around talk about music all day. All we do is music and that’s all that matters.”"

"Edited to add: I'm going to dedicate Mondays to my healthy living update. Monday is the day I weigh in for Weight Watchers. I have friends dedicating themselves to healthy living- some through WW, some on their own. I'd love it if we can check in together each Monday and share successes, challenges, and so on as we feel comfortable. We're all going to crap together! Wait, that sounds wrong..."
"Don’t judge a book by its cover."
"I love sweets."
"Beer, not so much. For one thing, style variation is tremendous. Is there any product with such an expansive range of flavors? But even within styles, tastes are usually pretty easy to distinguish. Put five IPAs in a blind flight and have people taste them, and they'll be able to tell the difference. In beer, blind tasting is heartening for this reason. Unlike wine, the flavors are different enough that even a rank novice would be able to tell. (And trying to conceal a stout among them--good luck with that.) Not every style is as easy, but I don't think anyone would argue that beer is a lot more obvious than wine."

"When I worked at Starbucks I bought a pair of khaki shorts to augment my summer work wardrobe. The dress code there required black or khaki bottoms and I found a pair for 10 bucks at Nordstrom Rack and when I tried them on in the dressing room I shrugged and thought, \"Well, they're not the worst shorts in the world.\""

"My mother would rant and rail against the Georgia clay ground into my clothes on my adventures with Phillip. “Stay out of that creek!” she would shout, though we both knew it was for not. Before there was Phillip I had hosted tea parties and taught school with a legion of stuffed animals. I can’t imagine now what I had to offer him, though he would take a place at the tea table on occasion. Besides the creek and all it had to offer he tutored me in kick ball and won us a place in a pack of older kids who roamed the neighborhood."

We will be swapping gifts and I can't wait to share about that Monday! Anyway, until then, I thought I would share with you my latest and greatest pins from the most spectacular thing since sliced bread, (or as one of my best friends says, 'the best thing since the internet!') Pinterest. If you haven't drunk the Pinterest kool-aid you have no idea what you're missing..."
"How long will it be before the chipping of dogs is hailed as a success in curbing canine crime? We have recently had the absurd spectacle of a dog owner being prosecuted for letting her dog foul the pavement, with the evidence against her being the DNA extracted from the dog fæces! It will surely become mandatory for the dogs' DNA to be logged on the database linked to the microchip. The 'success' of DNA evidence will inevitably be used to justify recording the DNA of all people living in the UK, and of course, will be included in the mandatory ID Cards which we are soon to be forced to have (and pay for ourselves). ID Cards can be lost, so surely it will be logical for ID Cards to be replaced by microchips."

"And while Turton didn’t write this fact -- other research published on Sept 9 2008, by top investigative journalist Louise Flanagan of The Star newspaper, also showed that the water treatment plants across the country were so badly run by unqualified and often nearly illiterate personnel, that the Water Research Commission has had to resort to drawing up a very basic, cartoon-like manual to teach operators with symbols instead of in writing, how to make their drinking water safer."
"The space is quite comfortable--and had already attracted a pretty good crowd when we visited a little over a week ago. The front of the pub curls around a groovy bar, and there are open spaces in the back festooned with large, flat-screen TVs (tuned to a Bears game when I was there). They both suit the sports fan but remain comfortably out of the way for non-fans. At the end of the review, I'll copy in a minute of footage I shot at the pub so you can get a sense of the space."
"In no way, shape or form can I do justice to the life and times of Peter Tosh within the confines of a blog post. I would never even attempt to try. Its too daunting a task. Instead I turn to the the brilliant documentary 'Stepping Razor Red X - The Peter Tosh Story' directed by Nicholas Campbell and released in 1993 to tell the story. In fact, the power of the documentary is that it is told through Tosh's own words which he kept in a series of cassette tapes he recorded that were discovered after his death. (read a New York Times review of the film which helps put the documentary into context). The film succeeds in providing a detailed look at Tosh that is distinct and separate from the role he played in founding The Wailers and further helps to portray him as a separate musical personality with political and social viewpoints which clashed with that of the Jamaican establishment and government."

"While the link between calcium and weight loss is still feeble (in some studies it promotes greater weight loss, in others it’s a wash), it turns out that milk may really do a body good when it comes to belly fat. A 2010 study by researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham found that, among a group of more than 100 premenopausal women, fat was significantly reduced in those who consumed the most calcium-rich foods. In fact, for every 100 milligrams of calcium they consumed per day (that’s 1/2 cup of soft-serve frozen yogurt), they lost an inch of intra-abdominal fat—that’s the really bad stuff tucked in and around your internal organs that has been linked to higher rates of heart disease and cancer. Like magnesium, calcium can also help you sleep if you tend to be awakened by muscle soreness or cramps—the mineral, along with calcium, helps relax muscle nerves and fibers. How to get your dose: Dairy works, but there are other ways to get your calcium in as well, such as sardines, fortified orange juice, tofu, and dark leafy greens like kale and spinach."

"What are the classic items that you can add to your wardrobe that will never go out of style? What are timeless pieces that add style and class after fashion fades? That’s right…it’s time to talk about another essential piece you should add to your wardrobe. The clutch. I just LOVE clutches and can’t get enough of them! What’s that you say? You’re afraid to add a clutch to your wardrobe because you’ll lay it down somewhere and then forget it? Never fear…there are a lot of clutches these days that are made in the wristlet style, so they have a strap to wear around your wrist. Problem solved! Now you have no more excuses."
"For all the hoopla over Rebecca Black's video for \"Friday\" I can say I have successfully avoided having watched it, although I feel like I have based on all the chatter that has besmirched the interwebs since it hit YouTube. And at this point it I doubt I ever will. After all, with all the stuff I've read about it, I feel like I don't have to see it."
"When Toddler M was a baby, we spent most days playing with toys and running errands together. As he got older, about 15-18 months, that wasn't quite enough anymore. Our days seemed too long; we were both bored by the end of the day. We started adding some structured activities, and it was good for both of us."
"The trial of the Norwegian terrorist Anders Behring Breivik is scheduled to start in Oslo early next week. In the lead-up to the trial there has been lots of talk from various left-wing public figures and left-wing organizations about the need to expose the anti-Islamic ideology which they erroneously claim influenced Anders Behring Breivik into carrying out his sick attacks."
"So what does a girl do?"
"It’s been strange and different for sure, preparing for exams on a full year’s worth of material which also determine course grades for an entire year. Back in the U.S., my university followed a semester system and within each class in a semester course grades were determined by midterms, essays, projects, presentations, and participation in addition to the final exams which would normally count for at most 40% of the grade."

"This batch is a blend of a pull off the solera and fresh, non-soured beer. The solera was refilled with the fresh beer that did not go into the bottle. Straight solera beer could have stood on its own and would have been fantastic. But I wanted something with a sweet-sour balance for summer slurping."

"Virgins themselves at arranging this kind of festival, I have to say that the festival is better than feared. There is no reason for seasoned Ratebeerians to make their pilgrimage to the Øl & Mat festival in Oslo, but for those of us who live here, it does add some flavour to a city that only has one (or possibly two) beer bars of real class."
"You can see why it would be memorable to a young child, right?"
"Wednesday 28th December - another outfit I can finally fit back into to! As my son would say, \"Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah!\" I really like this outfit because it feels a bit more fun and fresh compared to what I usually wear, and I love the mix of the neutral colours - its not too far out of my comfort zone, but is jazzier than all black."

"Anyway, I had just learned to ride horses when the first spring show rolled around during my eighth grade year. I’d also become a proud horse owner thanks to my “second parents,” dear family friends who owned the farm right next to the school. Peaches and I had very little experience together as a team. She was young and considered “green,” or not at all well-trained. We were definitely not ready for a horse show, so I planned to watch and see what I could learn."
"...and you were definitely not happy to pose for them. You saw the neighbor's dog and wanted to run to the fence to check him out. You raced down the driveway, away from the camera, clomping your pink Mary Janes and laughing all the way."

"Other ornaments include the little pinkish shiny ball ornament with Paul’s name written in glitter—I think he made it when he was about six , and the little red velvet bows, bought at Michael’s after Christmas one year for a dollar. They bring a unifying theme to the tree. I say this, smiling, because our tree is, and has always been throughout the years, a hodge-podge of our life. And I like it that way. I don’t think I could ever have a ‘theme’ tree. Mine is a ‘memory’ tree."
"My chocolate polenta cake went down well too, especially with my niece Ella. We all agreed it was rather rich. Many preferred it with cream. I think I got it right this time. However, I still am not so keen on the texture. The grainy texture reminds of what I don't like about lots of gluten free flours. I'd much prefer to stick to flourless cakes with just ground almonds such as Jill Dupleix's recipe. Now what do I do with the rest of the maize flour?"
"“The ANC‘s U-turn on this matter is to be welcomed, as it will genuinely benefit our attempts to address the ongoing scourge of crime.”"
"Every trader, at some point in their career, will face a “losing streak”. This is a fact of this business, and actually a fact of life – in almost any venture or business there will be cycles where things are not going optimally. A “losing streak” can be composed of 2 losses, and in some cases can go a lot longer than that."
"We’re talking dogs that will eat anything. I mean anything. The piece de resistance is cat poop or retch. The older (aged) the better. These dogs wouldn’t even sniff the chips. What the heck are they made of, that my dogs just ignored. What the heck am I eating when I ingest the Sun chips? Are chips even made with biologic matter?"

"It is hopped with Saaz, and their essence is captured in the head. The flavor, however, is very gentle, boardering on sweet. The Saaz add a robust bitterness and the characteristic spiciness sets off the sweet nicely; it finishes mostly dryly, with just a bit of residual sugar. However, it is in no way challenging--all the notes are beguiling and you really have to remind yourself of the strength to avoid quaffing."

"Mix all your ingredients, apart from the flour and butter, together. Add 90% of the flour and start kneading. After a couple of minutes add the butter and remaining flour. Keep kneading for 10 minutes adding small bit of flour if the dough is too sticky, but avoid making it too hard."

"American-style wedding cakes are also becoming more popular in France. The traditional cake here is a huge \"piece montée\" of cream puffs in a pyramid covered in caramel. Macaron pyramids are also pretty common here. The New York wedding had an ice cream bar in addition to the cake. I've seen dessert buffets in both countries, obviously dessert is important no matter where you are! Cakes in France, be it for birthday, wedding, or other occasion, always have these huge sparklers in them, it's like fireworks on a cake."

"Certainly it’s possible to have a significant impact on the collective conversation of our time without exposing yourself to the thaumaturgic media. Though most mass media in every age are designed to force the recipient into a passive relationship to the incoming stream of information, disinformation, and thaumaturgy, there are always a few options that give the individual a voice or allow a conversation to take place, or both. The blogosphere is the current example of the species; a lively world of noncommercial monthly and weekly journals did the same thing through most of the twentieth century, and will no doubt do the same thing again through the second half or so of the twenty-first. There are other modes of shaping collective consciousness as well, of course, with the influence of personal example standing out in many ways as the most potent of the lot."

"No, you're not seeing double. This is indeed another Hello Kitty cake. There are some subtle differences though, if you want to compare. Go ahead, look between the two and we'll play a quick game of Spot the Difference. Ready? Go! ... How many did you find? I'll give you the obvious point for the Happy Birthday Michi. You'll also notice that this newer Hello Kitty has three whiskers on her right cheek instead of just two. If you looked crazy closely, there's also no gapping in this Hello Kitty's tank top or pant leg. I'm probably the only one who notices that though. Inner critic being harsh and all. Oh, and this cake was another vanilla chocolate chip too!"

"I’m so happy that Ronnie has access to team wheelchair sports through Sportable. He is a very athletic person, and always seems so excited to play basketball, lacrosse, track and field, etc. He never had that opportunity before joining our family, and he certainly doesn’t get it at school. But even more than the athletic opportunity, I like that he is meeting people who use wheelchairs and don’t let that stand in the way of living life to its fullest."
"“I declare that civil war is inevitable and is near at hand. When it comes the descendants of the heros of Lexington and Bunker Hill will be found equal in patriotism, courage and heroic endurance with the descendants of the heroes of Cowpens and Yorktown. For this reason I predict the civil war which is now at hand will be stubborn and of long duration.”"
"Whoops. This is what my refrigerator looks like:"
"With that in mind I haven’t rated this fours stars purely because ‘I liked it’, I find most history books fascinating. The rating comes from the fact it’s a very good and apparently well researched introduction to the time period. It’s a nice easy read that doesn’t feel overly academic but manages to fit a fuckton of information in. And, even better for a geek like me, it endnotes to the original sources and important secondary works pretty extensively – so if there’s anything a reader wants to question there’s normally a note in the back of the book directing them as to where the information came from. Now I didn’t do it but just knowing I can always makes me feel a bit happier. Despite the gimmicky title it is a book that could be read purely for fun or used as a starting point for academic work."
"It was a spontaneous moment. It will be Sunday morning tomorrow and what better time to have something indulgent. I had a few fresh blueberries leftover and about 3 to 4 ounces of Chevre goat cheese and I was standing in front of fresh bread at the farmers market.

You are definitely going to be in the limelight!"
"Spike, ever the skeptic, declares to two of Trixie’s fans “If I don’t see her vanquish the Ursa Major, I won’t believe it.” His demonstration is fair, but unwittingly sets the two fans to go and find an Ursa to vanquish. Bringing endangerment on Ponyville for the sake of proof is reprehensible enough; it’s made all the worse by the fact that Trixie is a fraud and is terrified by the impending Ursa."

"What I think Kirk partially overlooks, however, is that conservatism is not limited to those \"who find the permanent things more pleasing\". Such people will of course be conservative but most people who adopt a cautious attitude to social change do so for a more practical reason -- because they see that as serving their basic aim of a better life for the individual. Almost all of the most influential conservatives (e.g. Winston Churchill and Ronald Reagan) were in their earlier years Left-leaning, so their conservatism can hardly be attributed to an inborn preference for permanence or a dislike of change as such. They became conservative for a good reason -- to promote and conserve one thing in particular -- respect for the individual and for individual liberties. So, particularly in the progress-minded USA, Kirk speaks only for a small subset of conservatives."

"I realized this morning that I still felt very much like a cork–powerless over this storm. My soon to be ex-husband communicates with me as little as possible. I know that he has graduated university, I know he will need to find a place to live outside of the dorms, and a job to support himself. These decisions will affect my children, and, indirectly, me. A job will hopefully mean the beginning of child support, something I have struggled without. Will he propose to his new girlfriend once the divorce is final? Will she become part of my children’s life? How much longer until the paperwork for the bankruptcy and divorce are complete? When can I close this door and start the journey forward? All I get is silence."

"Mr. Brooks (Costner) is a serial killer, and there’s the first draw that makes this thing more interesting than your average cop thriller. This isn’t like Dexter where the hero is killing for a justifiable reason, no – Mr. Brooks just kills random people who haven’t done anything, and only because he is addicted to it. You could make the argument that his want to stop makes him a more likable character, but the ending of the movie squashes that one, and I think the fact that the film asks you to try and root for this guy is part of the challenge and the fun. He is aided by his sarcastic, murderous alter-ego (Hurt), appearing to him in spirit-form, urging him to kill and often being the little devil on his shoulder. Except there really isn’t an angel on his shoulder at all."
"Today was another trip to the vet for a glucose curve. Mom seemed a little more confident this time – at least, she wasn’t all broken down when she left. She asked the nurse to use her home meter to test as well, but apparently they couldn’t get a reading on it. I think it’s because they want Mom to buy the expensive Cat and Dog-specific glucose meter. Instead, she’s put that on her Yule list."

She says I have to fill in a slip before she can tap the number into the computer. She doesn't have any slips, I've got to get them from a man sitting at a desk back at the entry door.

With a week left before the SuperBowl of the off-season kicks off, the common consensus is that the Brownies will draft a WR with one of their first three picks. This is all well and good because the Brown’s score less than a devout virgin who’s father owns a large assortment of firearms. But the Orange and Brown can’t attach all their hopes and dreams to one new WR. They are going to have to find a sleeper who can contribute in the next few season. Here are four guys who could be available after the third round:"

"Heart attack: pain due to cardiac ischemia is more serious when a blockage in a cardiac vessel occurs as a result of the surface covering of a fatty plaque rupturing. If a blood clot (also called a thrombus) forms on the plaque, it can partially or completely block the artery of the heart and slow or block the flow of blood to the heart. If that occurs for more than 15 minutes the muscle may become damaged or cause death of that area of the heart that the blood vessel supports. During a heart attack (also called a myocardial infarction) the patient may experience a sensation of chest pain that may be a sharp, dull or burning pain that is usually located in either the middle or upper chest (possibly the left side), and sometimes this pain may radiate to the back, arms, jaw or neck. The pain may get better or worse with activity or rest and there may be other symptoms such as sweating, nausea, rapid heart rate or shortness of breath."

When in school, siblings spend every day appart from each other, in separate grades, classrooms, and even schools (though seeing as you're not supposed to be socializing in class, I suppose it wouldn't make much of a difference if siblings where in the same class, anyway). Evenings are usually spent doing homework, or spending time with other friends. There's a stigma attached to hanging out with people of different ages, and I've definitely also encountered a stigma to liking family members. To many young people, actually liking a sibling enough to spend time with them just isn't cool.\" February"

"Anyway, Monday. First hour. Sort of a combination discovery flight, first lesson. We went off and did the 4 basics of flying. Climbs, turns, descents and straight and level. All flying is basically some combination of those 4. At least for fixed wing aircraft. We then went to a big wide empty field next to the runway and I proceeded to make myself airsick. My instructor, great guy by the way, sets up a hover and then give me the pedals. My only job is to maintain a heading. Keep the nose pointed at a big white pole just outside of this acre and a half field that we're in the middle of. Not too bad. Then he gave me the collective, throttle and pedals. Now, I'm supposed to maintain heading and height. A little worse, but okay. I'm only bouncing up and down maybe 10 ft. and swinging back and forth maybe 30 degrees. Then he says he's gonna take back the collective, throttle and pedals and he's gonna give me just the cyclic. At this point I KNOW this man is insane and suicidal."

"The main reason the Afrikaner Nationalists even rose to power in the new British created macro state at all was due to the excesses of British brutality in the concentration camps which lead to the deaths of 24 000 Boer children - which was close to 50 % of the Boer child population - of which the Afrikaner Nationalists were able to effectively marshal a political response to in the mobilization of the greater White Afrikaans speaking population even though this also lead to the marginalization of the actual Boer people in question since the loose political association of the White Afrikaans speaking groups made the Boer people a minority under the control of the Cape based Afrikaners who only used the Boers' history in order to justify their control of the new macro State imposed by the British with the South Africa Act of 1909 onto the region."

One looking at this video entitled “Obamaville” might not consider it to be the best in cinematography, nor that much predictive of two years hence, especially when one considers that everything in the video, is happening now. However, it is the negatives spelled out regarding Obama that is the crux of the matter coming from one Rick Santorum.

"The disc opens, boldly, with a nearly silent piece by Malfatti's colleague Jürg Frey, which consists entirely of a handful of low tones, played in unison by the two musicians, scattered amidst a vast field of nothingness. Opening the album with this piece is a way of acknowledging up front the spartan, airless world of the Wandelweiser group of composers with which Malfatti is associated, and the remainder of the album is in a sense a series of movements away from this territory. On the subsequent pieces — a Rowe-chosen Cornelius Cardew composition, plus a recent Malfatti composition and a graphic score made by Rowe — the music still tends towards the minimal, but abandons that near-silent austerity. Static and radio hum from Rowe form an electronic bed for long rumbling tones and breathy exhalations from Malfatti, and occasionally the serenity is interrupted by piercing, squealing feedback or gritty, granular bursts of electric noise. The music remains low-key and gestural in spite of these outbursts. By choosing his abstract graphic score \"Pollock '82\" as the final composed piece of the session, Rowe sets the stage for the improvisation to follow. The improvised third disc doesn't depart very far from the sonic territory that precedes it, because part of this album's ideology is to blur the boundaries between improvisation and composition; it's all just music to these two players. And there's no question that the relaxed, seamless interplay of this improvisation is informed by the composed pieces — whether loosely notated or entirely abstract — from earlier in the session.

While the grade was overall down, it wasn’t the steep down I had gotten used to, and now that I was on flatter terrain, I was starting to feel the beating the bottom of my feet was taking on the rocks and very hard dirt from the super dry winter. On my first 20 mile run on the Rocky Raccoon Course back in November 2011 I had the same thing happen. I kept running, and did my best to keep my pace up, but the pain in the balls of my feet started to really get into my head. There was an unexpected Aid Station at mile 22. I slowed down to crab 2 more cookies, and as I walked out with an older gentleman, trying to get my cookies down, and get out of my head with the pain in my feet, noticed he was limping and seemed to be really struggling. He didn’t have any electrolyte or salt replacement and said he was cramping badly. I took off my pack, and not thinking gave him my last 2 Saltstik caplets, figuring he needed them much more, and my only Tylenol, figuring I only had 3 miles left. Besides, I remember well the aid station volunteer at RR100 giving my pacer a bunch of Endurolytes to get me through my race there, so I felt like maybe I was giving back a bit."

"So this is set in deepest darkest Wessex in the Dark Ages - the bit from when the Romans tired after 400 years of building roads and palaces etc. in England and withdrew back to a crumbling Rome and before the dashing French Normans arrived to instill civility once again on the heathen pagan Celts of England. However it wasn't really like that was it? I've always been fascinated by that period of our history largely since so little is known as there wasn't much written down but you look at finds like The Sutton Hoo ship burial and the recently unearthed Shropshire hoard and you realise that this was a culture with stunning craftsmanship and global international trade. You can't have that if it was just a violent, chaotic and anarchic place. Oh and anyway the Normans weren't dashing Frenchmen, they were rampaging, colonising Vikings who had only conquered the French lands they invaded us from a 100 or so years before 1066."

"This was a strange choice for me to read since i never A) read romance, B) never read erotica, and C) hardly ever like books that have weak female main characters. A co-worker of mine had the book given to her and was totally shocked int he contents (not have heard of these books before). She glossed over what the book was about, and handed it to me. So although surprised and a bit shocked, I did get into the book, and was blushing a lot of the way through! Haha... me and my conservative mind were nicely twisted around this novel and the world that Anastasia Steel would be introduced to by Christian Grey. The first 100 or so pages had me bored to death and I was quickly reminded of the Twilight trilogy. It was funny to find out that these books were an erotic homage to those – but it is very obvious. Anyway, much like Bella Swan, I have a hate on for Anastasia Steel. And much like the twilight series, I was more interested in the dark tones of this book and the ‘why’ behind it. Still, it definitely had enough plot to keep the book together, and enough kinky fuckery for any adult to gape and blush over."

While it was necessary for me to keep on obeying the sat-nav’s last instruction in the absence of a newer one, I was nonetheless required to obey any new ones as soon as they were received. If I only listened for and obeyed the sat-nav’s previous instruction and obeyed it verbatim and fully, but fail to obey the current and newer instructions that it issues, arriving at my destination will be impossible. This point is quite crucial and important as many of us fail to arrive at God’s destination for our lives as we are living life based on what He ‘said’ and not what He is ‘saying’ now."

"I had a wonderful day celebrating being a mother! Truly being a mother is so amazing, better then I could have ever imagined. To have somebody love you, need you, want you, it's just wonderful! Ella is so big and she is a dream come true for this momma's heart. I never knew what my journey to motherhood would look like, I never knew what I would face as a mother. The fear of losing the little girl who really made my life feel worth while. Being Ella's mommy is perfect. The fear and pain that comes with being a heart mom is just a hint of this life compared to the JOY that radiates from her. Truly, I can honestly say, with my whole heart, that if I lose her, every single moment I would have gotten to spend with her would be worth it. I can't say what the rest of my life would look like, but no matter the future I am honored and blessed to be Ella Dawn's mommy. She is happy 99% of the time, she is ornery enough to be adorable and adventurous and obedient enough to earn my trust. She loves outside and all things girly. My wish as her mother is that I will help her reach her potential and help her to face this life that she has been given with an attitude of gratefulness and determination. Where she doesn't feel afraid to live, where she isn't afraid to die. I wish for her to know everyday is a gift, she is not better or worse then those who have a whole heart. She is loved by her maker, and He loves her dearly. The love I have the privilege of feeling towards my sweet Ella helps me trust God with her and my future. If He truly loves me the way the Bible says He does then the safest place we can ever be is in His will. I am human and I would die before I would purposely allow harm near Ella, how much more capable of Love is The perfect God who knows and created all? How grateful I am for that knowledge. Even though I will never grasp the depth of His love, just knowing it's more then my love for Ella let's me know it's enough. I hope you all had a wonderful mother's day celebrating! Never take being a mother for granted, it is a wonderful GIFT! Everyday should be lived to the fullest, make time to love on the little ones in your life, being a mommy certainly isn't the most glamorous job, and for Ella and I it is certainly not a job where I get to get out often, but the days are flying by and for me I love being a mommy every moment of everyday. Every sacrifice, every day that you spend in pj's, every time you miss a full nights sleep, every time you change a diaper, every time you clean up the same mess for the 5th time the same day, every time you read the favorite book again, it's all worth it, it's all a blessing, it's all important. I have seen too many mommy's with empty arms as the days were cut short. As my heart aches with each new loss I see nearly weekly it drives me to love Ella better. Not through fear of the future, but simply realizing the gift of today. Happy Mother's Day, may you Love deeper, this year as you enjoy the blessing of Motherhood!"

There's a little monument also to a more modernist social architecture – Powell Alport and Partners' Tredegar Library, a striking, dynamic little piece of Brutalism, a riot of angles and geometries now accompanied by a mural of the town's radical heritage. It bears repeating that the idea of the National Health Service was born here, not in Manchester, not in Birmingham, not in London.

"As bad as the comments section on Brookhouse’s article became, it had nothing on the comments for Maggie Hendricks’ piece. This isn’t the first time the MMA community has turned deplorable on Hendricks’ articles, most notably when Joe Rogan referred to her as “cunty” and the community took up for their hero to blast her repeatedly. Now, I’m no Rogan basher. In fact, I’m a big fan. The Joe Rogan Experience, The Bugle and Sklarbro Country are the only podcasts I listen to every episode of. But tearing into a woman with the most disgusting hate speech imaginable for rightly pointing out that there is a distinction between Rogan speaking as a comic (on stage) and Rogan as a UFC representative (on the Underground) is a sign of a deeper problem.

Kids don’t need to be in or see war, and I am at peace with what we are doing. However, in parallel, they are working in the department on evacuating entire families from the city by means of all different projects which have come under the Jewish Agency’s subsidies – some with families who will host them, and some through rich capitalists like Arcadi Gaidamak. It is an entire enterprise, a well-oiled machine whose product is transferring people from place to place. When I asked one of the workers in the department what he thought about all of these people running away from the city, and why he is working in it, while at the same time staying in the city himself, what about the contradiction there? He simply answered, “To help the people out of the city, I am paid 2-3 times what I normally get.” So if that’s the logic, I have already passed the point of sucker, and become simply an unidentifiable element, something from an encyclopedia. My friends today, real “friends-at-arms,” are basically the greatest enemies of my way of thinking. So I’m not angry at them, and I certainly do not feel un-needed; only a little bit alone and disappointed.

"Storrie goes nowhere near the digital: his delirium remains grounded in the spatial and personal experience of the museum environment. But these tendencies to critique, and more importantly to the expansion of the museum into everyday life are not without their online manifestations. It’s true that net.art remains the great unrealised promise of the internet setting art free, a promise that over-sponsored pixel-pretty shows like Decode fail to redeem. But when with even modest technological means at their disposal museums are capable of opening up photographic archives to the public, teaching science through games, making curatorial processes transparent through blogs and asking the public to contribute to exhibitions years before they open, it seems odd that Google Art Project should feel so like a CD-ROM, the kind of representation of a gallery that those of us who work with museums online for a living had abandoned before the first dotcom bubble even burst. Why has the world’s leading technology company delivered us a ‘virtual museum’ that belongs to the 1930s?"

"I don’t know if this is what the fight was for. And what did Team Anna get? All small issues like saving money by travelling on budget flights, celebrating birthdays and failure to pay money for breaking employment bonds were raked up. Mud was smeared on all of them. Possibly there were even people who believed these acts were as bad as the 3G and CWG scams. The credibility of the team has been systematically eroded and people have gone back to believing everyone is selfish and corrupt and nothing is going to change in this country. No wonder no one came out this time."

"Published by PhotoIreland, 2011"
"In these early chapters of Genesis, we have a window into the fullness of God’s plan for creation and for human persons. Before the fall, Adam and Eve were free from the constraints of sin. They were naked and unashamed, and they were free from any urge to misuse each other. Their vision was not clouded by shame. They were free to give themselves to each other, free to make a gift of themselves."
"I picked it up and started reading. And found that I couldn't put it down. Zombies play a huge role in this book. The things that happen couldn't happen without them. And yet, somehow, the novel isn't really about zombies. It is a YA book. It has the structures and concerns of many YA books. And it is a stand-out YA."
"Do you want to buy a watch? Actually watches provide a large selection of functions. You can buy watches for fashion ornament or for calisthenics aid. Before purchasing the latest watch, there are some hints that you should consider, as follows."

"Now Gunnlaug went from Hladir with six men to Lifangr; and, on the morning of the very day whereas Gunnlaug came in in the evening, Raven had left Lifangr with four men. Thence Gunnlaug went to Vera-dale, and came always in the evening to where Raven had been the night before."

"Because the Earth is a spheroid, a constructive plate margin cannot extend at the same speed at all latitudes, therefore constructive margins also have a whole load of transform strike-slip faults which allow the ridge to offset, and accommodate variable spreading rates. There’s an example of these from the Mid Atlantic Ridge shown below. These things, once formed, remain as weaknesses in the oceanic crust throughout its lifecycle."

"Even if I don’t contest there, if Umno … you see we have 19,000 or 20,000 Umno members in Jerantut. If every Umno member votes for a BN candidate, there’s no way Jerantut will lose to the Opposition."
"For instance, when my brother consistently uses drugs, he becomes a completely different person who I do not identify with, nor feel is my brother. When in wilderness (i.e., rehab), he wrote us letters and, with each letter we received, it seemed that he was improving and returning to his old self. Even though I was hesitant to let him back in my life, my entire family was convinced that he was getting better, that everything would be fine, we could all stop worrying. By seeing this progress, we believed that he was returning to who he was."
"I’ve set some goals for the New Year (it's never too late). Twelve goals, for each month of the year. Of course I have some relational and spiritual goals as well, but the following goals are related to food, cooking, and health. I've found that one goal per month is realistic and much better than a weekly goal. I've also found that I learn best through my mistakes, so a full month gives me more time for trial and error."

"I vaguely remember Michael Fassbender from Inglourious Basterds but, to be honest, I never really paid much attention to him. Until now. Damn, that boy can act too. I liked that he looked a little older than everyone else after what he’d been through during the holocaust and the scene in the bar in Argentina was one of my fave moments in the film."

"One short year ago, the girls used to hide their phones inside their purses on their desks, and text with one hand; and guys in the back of the room leaned against the wall, baseball cap brim pulled down, and cradled the phone just below the edge of their desks. Now, they are unabashedly overt, nestling the phone in their laps or laying it in plain view on the top of the desk and texting “unobtrusively.”"
"Beat butter with sugars in a large bowl with an electric mixer until pale and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Lightly beat 1 egg and add 1 3/4 T of it plus 2 remaining whole eggs to butter mixture, beating with mixer until creamy, about 1 minute. Beat in vanilla. Reduce speed to low and mix in flour mixture until just blended, stir in chips. At this point, I refrigerated the dough for 2 days, the recipe doesn't call for that."

"When you were a child were you treated with respect and unconditional love? Or were you molded to be the person your parents wanted you to be? Were your passions encouraged or frowned upon?

"Peter and Bobby Farrelly have been working on this movie since 1999.

"I finally saw the movie Dark Passage last week, being on my to-watch list for a while. Filmed in many locations in San Francisco, including Market Street, Telegraph Hill and Fort Point, I think it's the best pairing of Bogart and real-life love (and wife) Lauren Bacall, even though the movie did not do well at the box office. But it's a true noir, with all the requisite twists and dark characters, except that this movie has a happy ending."
"The Internet has invaded our brains, the Siren song of so many distractions. Social networking makes us more and more like city folk in our ability to hear the mostly mundane, yet oddly enticing news from our friends in mere nano-seconds.

"Margaret Mahy's book has also had a different title. In New Zealand where Harper Collins published it last year, it was called The Magician of Hoad. And if you go to the Faber website in the UK it has a huge subtitle shown on the jacket as The Battle for the Heart of Hoad."
"The carriage roads and the bridges that grace them are one of the many things that make Acadia unique among America’s national parks. I know I will continue to visit and enjoy the wonderful legacy of Mr. Rockefeller and his roads."
"It also clips the wings of the criticism of Arsène’s transfer activity, a source of dissension as the summer window passes by with everyone but Arsenal signing players. Last year’s accusations of panic buying were a step too far; I think it only applied to Park with the coming deadline (and drubbing at Old Trafford) forcing the club’s hand in terms of fees. As I have suggested before, I still cannot fathom the signing of Park and will to some extent be surprised if he survives this summer at the club. There has to be more to it than the manager finding him to be lower in ability than the scouting reports suggested but his future is more likely to be linked to whom Arsenal retain or sign than his own desire."
"JH"
"I have seen some comments lately that make me wonder. These comments, many of which are easy to see how they could be made, are not reflective of what we are called to by Jesus. They are attacks of a personal nature and not directed at the sin. We cannot be witnesses of grace and mercy if we are attacking the very people who need it."
"Where has the time gone?! And what in the world am I doing in my career? Do I even really have a career, or am I just working? How did I get to where I am right now? Am I happy? I don't know anymore. But I am generally a happy person! I firmly believe in waking up in the morning and choosing your attitude - a good attitude! And invoking grace in the face of others' bad behavior. You know, killing 'em with kindness. Maybe even trying out what my sister suggested, \"faking 'til I feel it.\""

"In order to ‘let’ your networks operate at maximum robustness, however, you must learn about yourself and the world and the ways in which they are interconnected. Understanding the immanent order of the world, that which gave rise to valuation, is what allows us to promote robustness. It is in this manner that network ethics proposes something quite similar to what Spinoza called the ‘intellectual love of god’ as its primary ethical goal. This goal is also quite similar to that of the ancient Stoics, a clear influence on Spinoza’s immanent ethics, as well as Nietzsche’s own attempt to create a ‘this-worldly ethics’. Linking this to genealogy is the project of metaleptics, and it is in this manner that the project of network ethics works to ground itself by valuing itself, and thereby ‘eating its own tail’, so to speak."

Sure, I think you'll learn a lot about this specific movie and indie filmmaking in general from our talk, but I think you'll also learn about us and who we were all those years ago.

"As you may notice there are no pictures of her doing her tap dance. They don't allow flash photography at the actual review.

Well she came out on stage to do her tap dance during the rehearsal and saw me in front of the stage ready to take pictures and broke down to tears. She wouldn't stop so she walked over to me and I was holding. I had about convinced her to go back on stage and practice with her class when a girl did a shuffle step and her tap shoe flew off and hit Gabby in the back. After that there was no convincing her. Luckily the night of the show she was all smiles and performed all of her dances perfectly. We are so proud of her and so excited for all the future dance reviews we get to go to.

How this ties into the way he himself was raised is adds more heartbreaking depth to the film. I can’t really point to what film-making strategies make Buck one of the best films of the year, but all I know is it tells a powerful story and tells it well."

"Appenzeller cheese is produced in Northeast Switzerland. It is made from cow’s milk and is a hard cheese. An herbal brine is applied to cheese during curing to promote the rind. There are 75 dairies producing Appenzeller. This is a pretty good photo because it shows the small holes and the golden rind. It smells strong but it does not taste as strong as it smells. It melts nicely on the tongue and is smooth. It had taste characteristics similar to the Mont Vully. It was mildly salty, earthy, nutty and lightly fruity. I could not decide if I preferred the Appenzeller or the Mont Vully. They are a bit different but I liked them both in a way I find hard to describe."

"ETA on 4/29/12: Since this post, 2 of my 6 children have actually developed MRSA boils. The first one was very large and freaked me out, so we treated it with Bactrim and after 10 days it still wasn't completely gone. I decided it was time for natural remedies. After 24 hours on colloidal silver it was GONE. Since then, I've treated 4 boils naturally and within 48 -72 hours they are gone. Only the high ppm colloidal silver works to get rid of them. We use 400ppm from this company. Make sure to order the extra strength. My foster kids with poor immune systems are the only ones who seem to suffer from the MRSA boils. As soon as they develop one, I gently squeeze out as much pus as I can and then spray on a mixture of colloidal silver and tea tree oil. Then they get 1/ml orally of 400ppm colloidal silver 3/times a day until it's gone. I've since discovered that if I give them 1/ml every day, once a day, it keeps the boils away. One other remedy I do in conjunction that I believe is extremely important and essential is homeopathic silicea. I give them 2 tablets every day until it's gone. Homeopathic silicea has proven to be an absolute must-have remedy for my foster children. It is great for vaccine injuries, failure to thrive, and really just poor health in general. For more info on it, see this link. It does an excellent job at stimulating appetites! Plus, it is a remedy that you only have to dose once a month or so. The bottle of 500 tablets for $6 is a great investment! Don't forget the tea tree oil also. This is what I buy from vitacost. If you put it directly on the skin, make sure to mix it with another kind of oil so it doesn't burn. I use coconut oil. Don't be terrified of this bacteria, just educate yourself so that you know how to treat it effectively, quickly and hopefully painlessly."

"The St. Patrick’s Day parade in New York was started by the Ancient Order of Hibernians, a Catholic organization. The Hibernians ran the parade up until the 90’s – now a separate, independent group runs it. The way the Catholics uphold the “gays can’t march” rule is due to a 1990′s Supreme Court decision in Boston that deemed the St. Patrick’s Day parade a “private, religious procession”. Yes, the biggest Irish parade in the world is a “private, religious procession”. WTF. It’s also important to note that the entire concept, idea, and original parade was conducted by a group of Irish soldiers. Better said, Irish-American soldiers. They marched downtown up to the original St. Patrick’s church on Mott and Prince, were blessed by the priest, and then headed off to the Irish pubs to get drunk. The parade TODAY is till led by the 165th cavalry, which is supposed to act as an extension of those original Irish soldiers. It is amazing to me that an organization that is SO linked with the U.S. military, would hold fast to its anti-gay practices even after the entire U.S. military has abandoned them!"

"I constructed the skirt in the style of an 18th century petticoat. This is basically two rectangles attached to twill or linen tape, which are then tied around the waist. The advantage of this is that it creates two openings on the side through which you can access your pockets that are tied on underneath. Koshka the Cat has an excellent tutorial, titled, An Easy, Authentic Eighteenth Century Petticoat. The skirt is edged in 4 yards of gathered black lace. In addition to making the skirt cocktail length I decided to give it a little bit of kick with a net petticoat underneath. I already had a black net petticoat in the stash that I purchased at a theater costume sale. The skirt had one opening in the back and I converted it to the 18th c. petticoat style and adde a yoke at the top to give it more length. Since this is a pirate costume I used a scrap piece of skull print cotton that I can't remember why I bought it.

"Alright, Glee. That’s what I’m talking about. After a very disappointing return from the mid-season finale, you’re back at full-power with what was without question the best “tribute” episode of the entire series. I wish that it has not been four days since I watched this episode because some of the plot details have become sort of hazy in the buzzed state of mind I’ve been in thanks to my sinus pressure and allergy medication because the only other episodes from this season of Glee that I thought were as good as this one were “On My Way” and “The First Time.” So, while I’m going to have plenty of rave things to say about how much I enjoyed this episode (whether it was the uniformly beautiful musical performances, the actual storytelling on display during the “tribute” episode, or the numerous times the episode made me cry), this will likely be a relatively short review just because of the sheer amount of writing I have to get out of the way today. Regardless, I’m still managing to find myself amazed about how much I was able to enjoy an episode dedicated to Whitney Houston even though I wasn’t especially familiar with a lot of her music before I watched this episode."

Well, one of the last times I was at CVS buying nail polish, I also happened to grab one of these nifty little polish removers. I’ve used one before and remember liking it, but wow, I REALLY like it! It makes removing polish so easy and even comes with a cool little sponge to use on your toes. If you hate using regular remover with cotton balls or tissue, get yourself one of these! You just stick your finger down into the sponge and twist a few times. It works really fast, doesn’t smell too bad, and is supposed to be good for your cuticles. Glitter polishes will always be harder to remove (I keep some pure acetone around for that), but for your regular polishes, this thing is the way to go."

"It was a quick trip this weekend. We went to Houston for Grace's dance recital. Friday to Sunday. We enjoyed it, but are glad to be home. This trip brought home to me just how much I'm missing by not being able to miss too many Sundays at PBC. I've got some major thinking to do!!! We saw the video of their piano recitals and some great video of their church play."
"I need therapy. Seriously. I love to shop at King Arthur online. This store is my toy store. I have been slowly accumulating their products, and have been experimenting with them. I discovered that the Vital Wheat Gluten really helped my Pioneer Woman Buttered Rosemary Rolls to rise beautifully. The three products that you see pictured above, were going on a maiden voyage for this recipe I'm about to show you. I've used Fleishmann's Rapid Rise Yeast for ages. I decided to buy a bag of SAF Instant yeast, since bread bakers rave about it. Enough product talk... let's talk about yeast. The SAF Instant yeast is supposed to not need any kind of \"proofing\". That translates, simply, into dissolving the yeast with some sort of sugar-- honey or sugar, for example and waiting for it to \"foam\". I think people are afraid of killing the yeast. One more important thing-- I store my yeast in the refrigerator (some people use the freezer) and check the expiration date! Yeast should be live!"

"Don't you just love this Wendy Vecchi stamp? It has such a lovely look - like vintage lace. I stamped onto white CS with Ranger Archival Jet Black ink. The stamp wasn't large enough to cover the entire tag so I filled in the blank space at the bottom with script stamp from Wendy's Live and Make Art set. To cover the joining and give some extra white, I layered some white paper twist ribbon over it. The sentiment was stamped on the Movers and Shapers Mini Label and then it was given just one coat of UTEE and sponged with Victorian Velvet. I had a scrap of the millinery netting floating around my desk from another project I worked on this week and thought it added just the right touch to my little vintage creation. That stuff was super expensive, but I picked u a few yards to sell in my Etsy as I had several requests for it and it does make a fun addition to a make."

"The color should be in fact the first thought of any gardener: even if the design is pretty basic, depending on the room you have to spend for your flower garden, the color goes by the name of the flower garden. The color is like a person’s eyes are drawn to your flower garden, be sure and get the most enjoyment from your garden of flowers, if the colors are proper located. I’ve always had a lot of satisfaction from my flower garden during the many years. I have been tending and planning and changing."

"The Five Boroughs Music Festival is an undertaking to which I'm admittedly partial. With (mostly) young artists, a wide-ranging repertoire, and lots of enthusiasm, their self-appointed mission is to bring creative classical programming to all of NYC. Loud cheers from this outer-borough blogger. Their latest project has been the commissioning of twenty songs, from twenty different composers, celebrating the city's architecture, history, and inhabitants... and even, wryly, its transit system. This has given rise not only to an acclaimed concert series, but also the festival's first recording."

That's exactly what Frank Cagle is calling for in Tennessee in his latest \"Frank Talk\" column in the Knoxville weekly Metro Pulse. Tennessee's liquor code, says Cagle, is too broke to fix. \"Sometimes a thing has been patched so many times it’s better to throw it out and start over.\" One look at The Almighty Liquor Code will convince you that it's time to throw it out. The twisted, tangled lawyerese that it is written in damns it to constant tinkering. The PA Liquor Code should be scrapped, and rewritten, in simple language, with consumer oversight, as a model of simple common sense in alcohol policy. First thing to go? All such Repeal-era language as this, the opening justification for the Code:"

"This plunge towards the Sun, is, of course, heading for that twice-in-a-century event, the Venus transit of the Sun. We already had a shot in 2004 at a transit of Venus, but these events come in pairs. The June 5, 2012 transit is the second of the pair for this century. I’m really looking forward to this one. For North America, only the first part of the transit will be visible with sunset interrupting it. Weather prospects are pretty problematic too. I plan to set up special equipment, properly filtered for safely viewing the Sun, in my favorite location with an unobstructed western horizon. But I’m also scouting other locations within reasonable driving distance, if the weather looks more favorable north or west of here. I’ll publish a separate post with more details for viewing the transit which will be widely available from different locations on Earth and provides a way to relive some wonderful scientific history. In the 18th and 19th centuries viewing a transit of Venus was regarded as the key that would open the door to being able to calculate the actual size of our solar system. That provided the impetus for some fascinating – and downright heroic – scientific expeditions around the world."

"RR—One of the reasons I put those stories in there is that I wanted to present the entire picture of the stuff that goes on down there. It would be easy just to dismiss the Karankawa sightings. I talk to a lot of Bigfoot researchers around the country, many of which don’t wanna think there’s any paranormal aspect to the Bigfoot sightings. They think somehow it cheapens the Bigfoot research efforts if you bring up anything weird or pertaining to the paranormal. And the same way with UFO investigators. They don’t wanna to think it has anything to do with Bigfoot. And by the same token I could have ignored these stories about the Karankawa Indians."
"Soon after introductions, we headed out for the tour. We began with Lia walking us through the tour and talking more in-depth about each piece and each artist that we saw, answering any questions that we had along the way. After that, she sent us off on our own for about 30 minutes to take photos. I hustled to take as many good shots as I could while keeping in mind Lia’s helpful hints from earlier. Surprisingly, I only got a little bit lost during my solo sojourn, a rare achievement in my life–so rare that I usually factor in time for getting lost any time that I wonder outside of Manhattan (or, frankly, any time that I wander beyond Manhattan’s directionally-helpful grid of streets and avenues). Finally, I made it back to the starting point, the first in the group to do so (look at me, being on time and even early!)."
"Last year, I had such a “chatty” group that I knew that this activity would be quite a challenge. I also had a student teacher that was supposed to be taking over for the last six weeks of the year! I must admit that I just couldn’t visualize my student teacher managing this activity with this particularly challenging group of children. There were a few of them that really never mastered keeping their thoughts to themselves during whole group activities like this, so for the first time in YEARS, we did NOT do the calendar book! I just felt that it would be an exercise in frustration for all concerned. I also really didn’t have the volunteer help to keep the calendar book updated with fresh papers each month. So I opted for more activities that we could learn from that would still allow them to talk and move around a bit more, since this seemed to suit the learning style of my group last year. We also did more journaling and more science experiments, so it all turned out okay. I can’t wait to see what next year will bring! I am hoping (and praying!) for a group that loves to sing, learns well through singing, and with lots of supportive parents. What does your “dream class” look like? :) Enjoy what is left of your summer, (if there is any of it left!) and keep on hoping and praying for that “wonder” class!"
"“Discipline ‘makes’ individuals” states Foucault (1995, p. 170). He explains how there was, and perhaps still is, power over the people through the use of three techniques: hierarchical observation, normalizing judgment, and the examination (p. 170). After reading this text, I find myself questioning my perceptions of life, my beliefs, and more specifically how I experience this model in the school system where I currently work. I will discuss the importance of the development of critical thinking, lost in the constructs described by Foucault, but vital for a change from “the ‘physics’ of power” (p. 177) to empowerment."

I’ll just do all my laundry while I read over my notes. Oh, since I’m down here in the kitchen, I might as well start something for dinner. Now that dinner’s over, it’s time to wash every dish we own. Oh my laundry’s done. Well, now I have to fold everything and put it away. What? It’s midnight already? But I haven’t even started! Oh well. I’ll get to it tomorrow. And I’d start the whole process over the next day, finding bathrooms to clean and closets to rearrange, until finally, the night before the paper was due, I’d be busting out 15 pages at 3am, just praying I’d get it done in time for my 8am class, and cursing myself for waiting so long."

"Bertram, or whoever he was, was doing his darndest to get through to me. He was practically jumping up and down and shouting, and he was putting a great deal of pressure on me. I didn’t like it one bit, and I held on to Orion for dear life, asking over and over, “Is this OK? Is this going to be a problem? Should I be working with this guy?” I couldn’t get a clear answer. I didn’t have the sense that Bertram was evil or malicious, but he was coming on awfully strong, and considering my previous negative experiences, I wanted to be cautious. I didn’t want to overreact or freak out, though, and I held a center of calm as best I could."
"In the role of Nightwing is Neil Patrick Harris who perfectly captures the light-hearted charisma and sharp wit of Batman’s original protégé. How the story portrays Dick Grayson is fantastic. Dick & Bruce work in tandem battling foes with grace and efficiency. They finish each other’s thoughts, both thinking the same amount of steps ahead to swing in at the right time for the save. I’ve always enjoyed Nightwing as a character full of potential. Here, he’s mainly involved in just the action sequences, but he makes them so much more dynamic with his acrobatics and sense of fun in the face of danger. I am wholehearted believer in the unlimited potential of Nightwing and Dick Grayson. By trusted accounts, he made for a wonderful Batman following the “Battle for the Cowl” comic story arc."

At one point, Elyse found a piece of Amelia Earhart's airplane. At another juncture, she helped find the S.S. Portland, a sunken ship in Alaska which was the first ship that found gold there!"

"This, I maintain, isn't trolling, this is a statement of the current reality. Whether or not people like it is moot. The only difference is context, I acknowledged it long ago, and the people who foolishly spent their money on that 4e shite aren't ready to let go. That's the only difference."

"Beckett's dramatic works do not rely on the traditional elements of drama. He trades in plot, characterization, and final solution, which had hitherto been the hallmarks of drama, for a series of concrete stage images. Language is useless, for he creates a mythical universe peopled by lonely creatures who struggle vainly to express the unexpressable. His characters exist in a terrible dreamlike vacuum, overcome by an overwhelming sense of bewilderment and grief, grotesquely attempting some form of communication, then crawling on, endlessly."

"Thinking back, that’s exactly what this kupiah-wearing snake did. I should have been more wary and suspicious of people instead of being so trusting; and had I known about these characteristics, I surely would have.

"Donoghue admits that some of her ability to write from the perspective of a five-year-old came from her son (who was five at the time she wrote the novel) and the true-to-life quality of Jack’s character definitely comes out in the way he plays, speaks and interacts with his mother. But even if Donoghue’s secret weapon was a living breathing boy, whose words and actions she could mimic, the development of a compelling and truly suspenseful novel from the vantage point of a veritable toddler is still a feat to be admired. Room is never simplistic, or boring, or even limited by its narrator. Rather, without Jack’s perspective, the book would be a different novel entirely."

"Lawyers then are an essential part of the legal profession and they cannot be dispensed with. They are of value to society but do not add value to society. We need them. Nevertheless there is a case that they, like all the rest of the law industry should be state owned. Clearly this has a significant number of downsides in terms of an even greater increase in bureaucracy and reduction in efficiency. Also the practicalities of doing it are not without problem. On the upside the benefit to society will be a reduction of legal costs, although lawyers as a group are likely to be less well remunerated. Gross industry fees are around £23 billion per annum which, to put it in perspective, is about the same size of the budget for all of Scotland. Slicing of the odd few billion should not be beyond the wit of man let alone sharp legal minds."

"The Trustees of the Medicare program have released their annual report on the solvency of the program. They calculate that the program is “expected to remain solvent until 2024, the same as last year’s estimate.” But what that headline obfuscates is that Obamacare’s tax increases and spending cuts are counted towards the program’s alleged “deficit-neutrality,” Medicare is to go bankrupt in 2016. And if you listen to Medicare’s own actuary, Richard Foster, the program’s bankruptcy could come even sooner than that."
"The Phillies are Sag's second favorite baseball team and he had hoped to go to a game while we were in Philly. I don't really pay attention to sports unless it pertains to Red Sox, Celtics or Patriots, and even then, my attention is fickle. So, I was surprised and dismayed when Phillies tickets, this early in the season, versus the Mets for heaven's sake, were impossible to get through the team's website."

"Our doctor visits are getting closer together now, and that makes it seem all the more real. A couple weeks ago Jason and I took the birthing class at the hospital, and I think that made us both feel a lot more confident about what's to come. We both learned a lot, and got some great tips that I'm sure come the day this little guys makes his appearance will go right out of our heads. I am thinking I may be spending some time...that is if we have the time...in the jetted tubs that each birthing room has at the Salem Hospital :)"

"Yes, the planet is in danger and it’s in danger from human activity. The solution is to stop those activities and we are headed in that direction. We have made substantial changes to the way we as Americans are doing business and we can do more but if we stop or give up we will have endangered what we love about our planet. Europe is doing better than we are but we need to persuade emerging nations that it benefits them economically to be friendly to the environment.

"In 1973 Canadian broadcaster Gordon Sinclair made a powerful radio address called \"The Americans\" in which he praised our incredible generosity and selflessness. \"The United States dollar took another pounding on German, French and British exchanges this morning, hitting the lowest point ever known in West Germany,\" he began. \"It has declined there by 41% since 1971 and this Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the most generous and possibly the least-appreciated people in all the world.\" With the American dollar now at record lows against the Euro, perhaps it's time to heed his words again. The United States is the world's largest giver of foreign aid. We give a whopping 0.13% of our gross domestic product in foreign aid, 81% of which we cleverly tied to the purchase of U.S. goods and services. Of the 21 richest countries in the world only Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Norway, Ireland, Belgium, Finland, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Canada, France, New Zealand, Australia, Spain, Austria, Italy, Germany and Portugal are more generous than the United States when it comes to foreign aid, according to the Center for Global Development. It's about time someone thanked us for being more charitable than Greece and Japan."
"Last weekend, our neighbors got their door kicked in and much stuff stolen. Curiously enough, we had just had a conversation with some other neighbors (they live next door to the ones that got robbed) about the abundance of break-ins in our cozy little ‘hood just the day before. After some research on our end, we found that our general area has been hit 80 times in the last month by thieves. Yeah, for real. They kick in your door, take your stuff and haul ass out. 80 times this has happened. Are we paranoid? You bet. We have since put in another deadbolt on our each of our exterior doors and installed a security system just this morning. Next up, a dog. One thing about situations like this is you really get to know who your neighbors are. We’re forming a small army. I would hate to mess with us now."

"A personal relationship means a relationship of response and awareness. A blade of grass receives its energy from Hashem. It cannot exist for even a split second without Hashem’s Will giving it life. Yet the grass does not have a real relationship because it cannot respond. It receives but all it gives back is its existence. There is no difference between one blade of grass and another. Hashem doesn’t respond to each one individually. There is no such thing as a righteous blade of grass who deserves lots of rain and sunshine, or a wicked blade of grass who has made major life mistakes. This is called hashgacha klalit, which means awareness without any involvement."

"Paxton Osgood is such a great character - she makes lists, she's obsessive about them. She's made them all her life. It is a way she controls her life, a way she can make sense of it. She prefers things to be done in a certain way. She's uptight, always well turned out and seems to be very much in charge, of everything. She is easily categorised - always popular in school, she got good grades, she was a social darling. But there is far more to the socialite than we are aware. Reluctant to move away from home, she has a very difficult relationship with her mum. Her dad zones in and out of life, letting his wife control things, as he's no doubt just found it easier to do accept what she wants to do, rather than try and fight her. Paxton, what a great name!, has a twin brother, Colin who, unlike Paxton cannot stand to be at home, with his family. He left Walls of Water to become a landscape architect and makes sure he hardly ever comes home. But this time he does, as Paxton has asked his help in landscaping the gardens at The Blue Ridge Madam, specifically to remove the huge peach tree that grew randomly from the soil near the house, and replace it with something else."

And if you want to see some change away from this untruth we have engulfed ourselves into, maybe next time we stop on a “reality” television show (such as Gene Simmons Family Jewels) we should lift our finger and change the channel. Or better yet, turn off the TV and find your own reality. It’s as simple as that. Click!"
"His cover of \"Sixteen Tons\" -- which featured a clarinet, and didn't really sound like a country-western song -- became a huge crossover hit in 1955.

Take, for example, the other evening, when I had made gluten-free chicken nuggets from scratch to appease the kids, and I was sort of rattling around the kitchen not really feeling inspired by the vegetable options. It wasn’t until I came across a random rogue sweet potato — also, itself, forgotten — that it occurred to me to revisit a certain sweet potato and green bean dish we had LOVED when I first concocted it."

"I still have moods that go up and down, and I'm still insecure about a lot of things, and simultaneously excited and afraid about the future. But life's like that isn't it. I think it swings between states of happiness and fear, satisfaction and laziness, pride and insecurity. Only non living systems stay in the same state permanently, until they are programmed to fall apart. If you're alive, and not under the influence of pharmaceuticals that claim to make you well, you're going to have to feel all those things."

But then after an hour and a half of mosquito-buzzed disturbed sleep I got out some odomos and moved to the floor inside the office. The next thing I remember is Iliaz waking me up at 3:45 the next morning like I’d asked him to."

A couple of centuries on since we established what they actually are it seems so obvious you may feel it should have been certain from the off. But hindsight is a wonderful thing and once the best supported argument has won out it only takes a little time until everyone thinks it was always known. Fossils are lumps of rock, beautifully sculpted into sometimes quite perfect reconstructions of a once living body. They are not strictly the remains of an organism but rather what comes after the remains, the post-remains if you will."

"Ever seen the NPR tiny desk series? These are bands who typically take command of a stage with amps, effects, roadies, and seething throngs of supporters. But instead, they are taking command of a room the size of my kitchen for a group of about 25. The result? Well, as long as the artist is worth a damn (think, the idea) it works at any scale. Is it different than the full-blown stage experience? Hell yeah. Is it as good or better? Certainly to the 25 people in the room it's better. Their expectations have been set for exclusive. intimate. Lo-Fi. And for the rest of us, watching at home, it's still pretty killer – thanks to NPR's broadcasting expertise."

I usually shrug and say that I've been a vegetarian for so long I don't really think about it. Part of the reason for this is that I'm not evangelical about it - we all have to find our own way through life in such matters. Another part though is a cop out, if I'm honest.

"The reality is often far less exciting than the expectations we conjure up -- and the litigation in Meakin v British Broadcasting Corporation, Paul Smith and Celador Productions [2010] EWHC 2065 (Ch), 27 July 2010, raised initial hopes that we would get some hugely important ruling on the protection of TV game-show format rights. As it was, the troops spent years lining up against each other (Meakin first complained of infringement in 2004) but the battle was over before it started, Mr Justice Arnold (Chancery Division, England and Wales) granting the defendants summary judgment against Meakin's claims of copyright infringement."

"5). Comedy Face of the Week. Now, this prize was hotly contested, mostly by Dr. G. I particularly liked the “Bloody hell, this is cold!” face that he pulled when he leapt into the Napa River, and came up spluttering something about how cold the water was. Then there was the face he pulled as his new girlfriend, Yolanda, started to chew on his ear. But, despite his best attempts, he has been pipped at the post by the stick insect with its novelty jumping act. Taking this photo was quite the challenge, since every time I got too close, this leggy insect would leap up into the air. If he was so inclined, he could even throw in a backward somersault, with a half twist."
"It reminds of what Fr. Paul Murray said in my Spiritual Theology class last semester. Jesus did not start his ministry by giving lectures. They needed something else. He started with love and mercy. Obviously he challenged them to recognize their sins but he did it through his love. It's the same way with men and women grieving over past abortion. You need to be sensitive to their hurt and help them to realize God can and does forgive them. But it does not help them to mitigate the truth and say it was not a sin. They need the truth but through a ministry of love."

"Or, conversely, maybe you're just doing what every other person on the planet does... which is looking at your own life and trying to fit it into some great, big cosmic pattern, because no one can stand the thought that they aren't right at the center of everything important. Which is why countless apocalyptic writers - like me, for instance - always seem to say the antichrist has just appeared. Or is just about to appear. Antiochus, Frederick II, Peter the Great, and a pile of other people have been named and accused and everyone held their breath, and whoever the boogeyman was just made his way through life, then croaked, and somehow the world didn't end."

This is a political conflict, and they should ask their leaders about what they have done to resolve the problem. But the problem is rooted in religion. A week or two ago, I read a short story in an Islamic book, according to which Muhammad was walking with some of his followers when they heard a commotion. They asked him: “What is this, Messenger of Allah?” He said: “These are the Jews being tormented in the grave.” Regardless of the conflicts Muhammad had with the Jews back then, this statement indicates that the graves of their ancestors were in Saudi Arabia, correct?"

There was no significant talk in Christian Endeavor about the Four Absolutes of the Oxford Group; of a life-changing “art” of self-examination, confession of sins to another person, conviction, and “conversion” leading to a spiritual awakening.

"The second question, and subsequent answer, require much inspection, but at the present moment, we are most concerned with how nature is materially possible. This is because the formal conditions for the possibility of nature pertain to the understanding, whereas, at present, our inquiry is primarily concerned with Kant’s musings on objects of experience ‘in’ space and time. For Kant, the latter is an investigation firstly of sensibility."

"Asheville exists effortlessly. It boldly inhabits the artistic spaces that so many other cities marginalize through bizarre zoning and an uncomfortably excessive rule of law. Guitarists, mandolin players, and all sorts of dilettantes of Eastern string instruments riddle the sidewalk. Asheville was founded as a sort of liaison between expanding white settlements and the Cherokee nation. This imbues the streets with Western quality. The casual milling of people resting between adventures mixing with the happy simplicity of musicians, writers, artists, and tattooed baristas (who are usually beautiful young women, I’ve never ordered so many double shots of espresso) basking in a warm vibrant culture."

"I prefer to let children do all of the above with rocks, twigs, dolls, dishes, hot wheels etc. The more they are allowed to relate math to their surroundings the easier it will be for them to identify how math is used everyday.

"Being held hostage by what the wind and the rains could do drove us more than a little nuts. Only so many goods can be baked, so many games played, so much shut-eye acquired. I know my grandparents were probably more than a little disappointed to find that this storm didn't require us to evacuate - if Lee had become a full-fledged hurricane, we'd have headed up to my parents' in Oklahoma City where, coincidentally, my grandparents happened to be visiting this past weekend. After having checked the Gulf Coast surf reports early Monday morning in a last-ditch gesture of eternal hope that was dashed on discovering the possible wave heights, I found myself wishing we'd piled into the car and gone anyhow, even if the closest body of water we'd be near would be the artificial Lake Hefner. Maybe if I were experiencing all of this by myself, things would've been different, but the cabin fever my husband was suffering was highly contagious."

"Other than my house, the outdoors were exciting and intimidating. I liked to be outside, yet I didn’t. I liked the outdoors because of the scent of nature. Astoria had this very natural smell because of the gardens in front of everyone’s house. I loved the smell of the outdoors especially when it was raining. Whenever there was rain, the world started to release all of her fragrances for us to inhale. The plants all come to life and tickle at the nose. In Astoria Park, there was a giant river called the East River. It’s not the cleanest river, but it is relaxing to watch and calms me. It reminds me of water, which reminds me of rain, which reminds me of the great outside that school pulls me away from."

"By now, Iron & Wine's Sam Beam has definitively left behind the intimate, guy-and-a-guitar acoustic folk that once defined his style. The process begun on 2007's The Shepherd's Dog has been completed on Kiss Each Other Clean, as Beam further refines and experiments with his newly fleshed-out, ambitious full-band arrangements and poppier flourishes. Opener \"Walking Far From Home\" ushers the album in on a bed of low, gurgling feedback with Beam's processed voice crooning mostly on its own at first, before being joined by ooh-ing background singers and increasingly dense accompaniment of keyboards and guitars. On \"Monkeys Uptown,\" Beam channels Paul Simon, with rubbery bass, distorted guitar twangs and percolating rhythms. The richness and warmth of the production emphasizes all the fine detailing of the arrangement. Beam seems to be reveling in defying expectations, building songs that twist and turn in unexpected ways without ever losing their accessibility and instant pop appeal. The highlights are numerous, but the standout tracks are the sing-songy, ambiguously sinister \"Rabbit Will Run\" and the exuberant 7-minute closer \"Your Fake Name Is Good Enough For Me,\" which blends Afrobeat horns with a stuttery rhythmic guitar for a joyful, epic sound. Beam's experimentation doesn't always pay off, as missteps like the awkward \"Big Burned Hand\" prove, but it's rare that he falters. A couple of lesser cuts aside, this is an album of sophisticated, compelling pop-folk. [buy]"

"After your turkey carcass has cooled enough for you to handle it (I place mine by an open window) you can remove the bone. This is where you gotta get tough like your grandma was. Just use your clean hands and start pulling. The bones should be pretty easy to pull out, and the meat should have fallen off. Any meat left on, simply pull it off. Toss the big pieces of skin. When I first did this, I would be really finicky about trying to get rid of every single teeny, tiny piece of bone & fat. It was pretty time consuming. But the more I do this, the more I leave for the stock. It's going to be SOUP! If someone finds a teeny little bone, it won't kill them, and I'm sure they're capable of removing it from their mouth without causing a scene."

This is the kind of place I could imagine staying in a B&B to experience truck driving, cowboy hat-wearing hunting culture with a gentrified buffer - kind of like folks in a resort and a tour bus might see Istanbul or Beijing.

Yet I keep returning to religious angles that I’ve never pursued in the past. I wonder who would want surveillance cameras above the pews glaring down at the worshippers? What could be so alarming to a room full of gun-owning, God-fearing middle-aged white people in a small town run by other white people? In other words, who really needs sacred security, and what is so damn frightening that you’d replace the free-flowing calm and compassionate welcome of the idealized church with an ominous sense of lock-down? Apparently, it is not enough that some deacons areliterally carrying guns to Sunday services or that some pastors are literally clasping specially-designed bulletproof Bible holders at the altars.

"4. The Pixar success story was another good Jobs pick of some very talented people who eventually found they could integrate their technology skills with an appeal – without sentiment or kitsch – to our shared humanity. Jobs invested in them when the animation was just a hobby – at the time they were trying to sell image rendering software. Note that, a bit like Xerox, the competing Disney corporate culture under CEO Michael Eisner had been so inimical to creativity (‘rapacious, soul-less’ – Roy E. Disney) that they had had no major box office successes for 10 years. 2006 saw a de facto reverse creative takeover by Pixar of Disney, with Pixar personnel now holding the key creative positions and (incidentally) Jobs becoming the single largest Disney shareholder (7 per cent of a current $37 billion valuation). The longest index subentries (under the main entry for Jobs) in Isaacson’s book are for ‘controlling personality of’ and ‘offensive behaviour of’, but with Pixar Jobs also clearly backed and continued to back, even under severe financial pressure, other people’s creative skills when conventional corporate wisdom would say bail out."

Businesses do not have a choice -- they have to put up those signs, which must be a certain size and colour according to the law, else they are fined and possibly put out of business for non-compliance. Business owners now cower in fear of the Nanny State, unable or unwilling to fight it. Does that sound like freedom to anyone? Does that sound like a country you want to live in? Every day this smoking ban goes on is a day we are not free to make our own choices."

"THE PRESIDENT: With respect to Social Security, Social Security is not the source of our deficit problems. Social Security, if it is part of a package, would be an issue of how do we make sure Social Security extends its life and is strengthened? So the reason to do Social Security is to strengthen Social Security to make sure that those benefits are there for seniors in the out-years. And the reason to include that potentially in this package is if you’re going to take a bunch of tough votes, you might as well do it now, as opposed to trying to muster up the political will to get something done further down in the future."

Slowly, taking his pace from the way my body shifted and relaxed, he began to probe my increasingly wet pussy lips with his fingers, then pushed gradually deeper and deeper inside me as I tried to keep my voice smooth and steady. By the time I had finished reading, my body was yearning for more, and I could feel the deep excitement of the endless possibilities before me."

It doesnt mean we forget to be kind to others either, but perhaps we share our kindness rather than holding back. This energy can mean you smile at more strangers or even chat with them, or perhaps you might share a perceived weakness with a coworker without fear of it reflecting negatively upon you. It could mean you share that much-loved inspiration with someone who you feared might laugh at it or reject it, but now you can let it be heard without that fear."

In essence, I was back with our motor home, boarding the Stena Line ferry (so quick and easy, so smooth a crossing, free WiFi; and so simple the disembarkation when we arrived in Dublin port). Approaching the Irish coast, I am looking again for THAT GREEN - a green peculiar to Ireland that I remembered from previous holidays - but it's evening and instead I am captivated by the misty blues, greys and purples of the Wicklow Mountains, silhoutted against the pearl of an early evening sky."

"“So Long You Pretty Thing” is a prime example of this. The song starts slow, sounding like the type of hymn a congregation would sing on Good Friday, or at a wake. Pierce sings out to God and Jesus, looking for succor and answers to the deepest of existential questions, “hoping for a reason to be here,” and “hoping for the reason to be clear.” But the song shifts at the 4:15 mark, where a chorus that combines both redemption and blessing rings out backed by horns, strings, and a choir. Nothing is ultimately answered, and it’s not even clear if Pierce is discouraged, but rather just hoping to offer a spark to light the way, as he fades into silence singing “sail on, so long.”"

The title of the discussion was ‘Pakistan: The Untold Story’. Umair happened to accompany me to this particular event, and we both were bemused and frustrated by the level of discussion. The purpose of the event, a small gathering held at the World Bank, was to tell people that it is not all doom and gloom in Pakistan. I thought it was a brilliant idea, get the academic community in DC jazzed about Pakistan, and to get them to look beyond the negativity that surrounds the country. However, what ended up happening was that the Pakistanis on the panel began to paint a picture of sunshine and roses blooming back home - i.e. they took 'positive' to a whole different level."

"By stage three, Mario must face numerous fiery ghosts. They appear out of nowhere and serve Donkey Kong’s bidding, suggesting a possible voodoo magic at work. Worse still, Mario cannot usually jump over the ghosts, and must rely on the hammers to defeat them. Blessed with his holy might, Mario has no problem dispensing these evil spirits, marking the first time that the carpenter strikes out at his sentient enemies. Once again, Pauline’s parasol and purse appear; apparently Mario gave them back to her but DK threw them away again. Perhaps he sees them as symbols of wealth, something that a black man in America can never have. Also once again, DK is portrayed as a stupid beast, and simply stands around dancing as Mario removes the floor from beneath him, sending him crashing to his doom. Even at the end of the game, the cycle begins anew, with the three levels constantly repeating themselves with increased difficulty. Obviously, the black man is not capable of redemption and must continuously undergo punishment for him baser instincts. This portrayal of African Americans is stunningly racist. By the year 1981, you think America and Japan would have evolved beyond such archaic views and stereotypes."

"First thing I have to mention is that the download link above for this song is an M4A file, aka, an iTunes file. As far as the song itself, though, it is the first single that Lisa Marie Presley has released since 2005 and is preceding a brand new album, “Storm & Grace,” which is being released May 15, 2012, which I couldn’t possibly be more excited about! I was a massive fan of Lisa’s first 2 records and saw her in concert in 2005 and, honestly, never really anticipated her making another record. I am so glad she is and, if this song is any indication, I am thinking the new album is going to be AMAZING. It is definitely taking a very different direction than her previous records, which were more rock-oriented. This song, on the other hand, has a really gorgeous, bluesy style. It has a really nice groove to it but maintains all the sass and attitude from her previous records! I always loved that sort of defiance and rebellion in all of her music, and it is definitely still present in this track, even 7 years down the road!"
"On Friday morning, I was once again awakened at the witching hour....3:30 am....with contractions. This time they were about 15 minutes apart. An hour later, they were still going strong and getting closer together....yay! Could this be the big moment? Nana was on the books to take the older kids, but it was so early in the morning, I didn't want to call her yet, just in case it was another round of fakey contractions. Around 5:15 am, the contractions were 10 minutes apart so I woke up the hubby just to warn him and went back downstairs to watch some DVRed CSI. He didn't seem too concerned and at first rolled over for a \"snooze button\" worth of extra sleep. A few minutes later I heard him get up and brush his teeth and begin getting ready. Within the next few minutes, the contractions went from 10 minutes apart to four minutes. Uh oh, the lightening fast labor I was yearning for was kicking into high gear. After getting his morning breath worthy enough to go public, Johnny called down to me to see how things were going. I told him they were four minutes apart and it was \"go time.\""

Well, while you WILL get a couple of assignments, you may not feel entirely comfortable doing that particular thing. For instance, I can DO background drawing, but it's a labor intensive activity for me, as opposed to cartooning and caricature which I can do in my sleep. When a client hires you to do a job, they're not expecting a generalist, they're expecting a master, who not only knows their subject inside out, but can even re invent and re adjust on the fly. When you are teaching, you don't want there to be any guesswork. You also want to have fun! Strive to teach on the subject that you KNOW. Doing so will help you develop your own niche, and it's this Niche which will focus you and make you stand out from the pack."

"I think it was with this book that Fleming toyed with killing off 007, having tired of the character and the hassles of dreaming up new adventures. It would have been the perfect vehicle. Instead of a third person report on the death of Bond (like he tried, almost, in From Russia, With Love), we have an eye witness report. The tell-tale sign occurs just before the final battle. Fleming practically foreshadows Bond's death when he tells her to \"remember who I was\". He gives her his 007 recognition number and runs off to fight. She wonders why he would use the past tense, and in the suspenseful fight that follows we hold our breath as Bond and the baddies shoot it out."

"How a religion formulates its relationship with pain is very telling. Is it good for you, as the older book religions sometimes suggest? Or is it something we can and should avoid, as modern society seems generally keener on as an idea? Do we need pain and misery in our lives to make us rounded, spiritual people, or do we need to overcome it in order to achieve permanent happiness? How a religion, or for that matter a religious person handles this issue can be quite telling."

"Mitt Romney, signaling that his entire campaign is going to consist of \"I'm rubber, you're glue\" arguments, is asserting that President Obama is the guy who's really waging a \"war on women.\" Romney says that 92.3% of the jobs lost in this country since Obama took office have been held by women -- which may be technically true but (you probably know all this) fails to take into account the fact that recessions go in predictable patterns, and this one began, predictably, with much greater job losses by man. It also includes job losses from the very beginning of Obama's term, when his policies hadn't taken effect and, thus, couldn't possibly have had an impact."

"This is basically a small cup of chowder with oysters in it. The soup was definitely made up largely of heavy cream, butter and maybe chopped chives.

I’m not gonna lie – I’m not on my game every day (like today when I turned off the alarm and got out of bed 20 minutes later) but there is a difference in things around here. And you know what? It really is the little things that add up to big things. Something as small as taking a couple minutes to grind my coffee and fill the kettle the night before can mean one less thing to think about when I’m still trying to wake up. Doing the dishes and clearing the counters the night before give me a clean slate in the morning. I’m not waking up feeling overwhelmed and am therefore in a better mood first thing."

They see their group in the best possible light. “People at my level know what is important. The people below haven’t got a clue.” In-group loyalty intensifies. Soon there are ‘people like us’ and ‘people like them.’ The people outside are depersonalized and easier to stereotype. The arrogant person can now, even subconsciously, pay attention only to that behavior which confirms why ‘those others’ are inferior."

I was inwardly relieved that it had been the kids' Cheerios and not my muesli. Tom told me that he had heroically grabbed the box with the mouse still inside, and given it a good shake. What he was trying to achieve with the shake I don't know, but he said the sound of a mouse thudding around amongst Cheerios was an odd sensation. He went out into the night and bravely threw the box and its dizzy inhabitant out into the garden."

"At the heart of Rio Conchos lies revenge – there’s essentially no nobility on show, nor very much in the way of finer feelings of any kind. The main character is Lassiter (Richard Boone), a former confederate Major who’s almost totally consumed with a killing rage sparked by the torture and murder of his wife and child by the Apache. This man hunts down and disposes of his enemy with a ruthless precision. The opening shots are of Lassiter calmly massacring an Apache burial party, before heading back to the ruins of his former home to get drunk amid the personal and physical devastation. He would appear content to spend the remainder of his existence extracting his pound of flesh every time the opportunity arose. But that’s not to be, as he finds himself coerced into participating in an army plan to recover a shipment of stolen rifles thought to be over the border in Mexico and soon to be sold to an eager Apache warlord, Bloodshirt (Rodolfo Acosta). Lassiter’s motivation, apart from a desire to get out of the army guardhouse, is the chance to even his personal score with Bloodshirt and he has no particular sympathy for the two cavalrymen, Captain Haven (Stuart Whitman) and Sergeant Franklyn (Jim Brown), that he’s guiding. Haven’s on a mission of vengeance too, being the man in charge of the original arms shipment that’s gone missing. His quest may be dressed up in the guise of duty, but there’s no hiding the fact that he too is seeking some form of recompense for the slight to his reputation. The party is completed by a Mexican rogue, Rodriguez (Tony Franciosa), whose involvement is quite simple: he’s out to avoid the hangman’s rope and hopefully line his pockets in the process. In the more traditional scenario, this ill-assorted group bound together by a common objective would include at least one member driven by some higher moral sense. Not in this case though; all (with the possible exception of the cipher-like Franklyn) are pandering to their own base instincts. Everything builds towards a surreal climax on the banks of the titular river, where a demented Colonel (Edmond O’Brien) twisted by the bitterness of defeat in the Civil War plots merciless retribution for his conquerors."

"“Looks like it’s time to rinse her off,” Andy said and with that the girls each grabbed Olivia under the arms and Andy grabbed her by the butt and they hoisted her up with her legs in the air with her soapy mound nearly eye level directly under the stream of cool water. Olivia shut her eyes and let out a moan as the cool water hit her clit. Andy moved her right hand up to Olivia’s pussy and slowly inserted first one, then two and finally three fingers, vigorously working the girl into a frenzy. The water was rushing over her body and with her butt aimed high in the air the soapy water was rolling down past her rounded breasts and streaming down her long black hair. With her head tilted back her hair nearly touched the floor as the soapy water dripped off it forming a slippery puddle on the tile floor. The girls continued to soap and fondle each other in the shower for some time enjoying the feeling of the water rushing over their bodies. After it was over they took turns toweling each other off accompanied by lots of giggling and caressing. After a bit of playful towel snapping and long kisses they helped each other get dressed and headed off to the dayroom."

We make others responsible for us finding a job; for us being able to obtain or maintain a home, whether renting or buying one; for us to lack the fear to start or invest in something new. However if we stop using the word crisis and accept that this is the new reality and realize that these are the new times and circumstances that are ours to live, then all of a sudden the responsibility to move forward in life is our own."

"And so it was that on their way out of town on Friday afternoon they happened to hear a story about the extraordinary efforts to rebuild and reopen the damaged section of the Pentagon within a year after the attacks. In the middle of the story, which featured Walker Lee Evey, a modest, genial-sounding fellow who managed the reconstruction project, they glanced out the car window and realized they were driving past -- the Pentagon. They marveled at that weird bit of synchronicity and went on their way. On the return trip Sunday evening, they listened to a selection of StoryCorps' 9/11 tributes and recollections. The stories are captivating, of course, recording with gut-wrenching specificity the individuality of lives lost and survivors struggling to carry on. They listened intently to one particularly powerful account by Beverly Eckert, whose husband Sean Rooney spoke to her for more than 30 minutes from the 105th floor of the World Trade Center until the collapse of the building cut off the call and his life. As Eckert's narrative ended, the dulcet-voiced reporter picked up the story -- with the tragic update that Eckert, who became a prominent advocate for those affected by the attacks, was killed in a plane crash in 2009 while flying to an event to honor her late husband. Both Moms gasped as they took in that painful detail, and as they struggled to absorb it the car rounded a curve -- and there again, across several ribbons of highway and in the soft light of a sweet late-summer evening, was the Pentagon."

"Most people think that being girly means pink, means princess, means sweet and kind and nurturing and demure and ruffles and sparkles and playing house. Most people think that being boyish means blue and construction vehicles and being aggressive and physical and emotionless and tools and dinosaurs and being rough. And for some kids, that might be true - see my note about biological differences. But all girls and all boys cannot possibly fall into those boxes. The differences between individuals is VASTLY greater than the differences between genders. And trying to put all of the members of one gender into the same pink or blue box with limited options is stifling and damaging."

"The trailer sheds no light on why Bane wages war against Gotham, but reportedly Bane is working in league with Ra’s al Ghul, played with such Zen-like menace by Liam Neeson in Batman Begins. The good news is that Tom Hardy’s garbled voice that freaked everyone out after the second trailer has been cleared up and sounds pretty cool."
"Come to think of it, that is probably how it got me started to host parties as I grew older. I found a lot of joy sharing my cooking and baking with my family and friends too. The best part is hearing them go ''ohhhh... oooOOooo..yuummmmmmmmMMmm\"."
"We must rediscover the power of ridicule, the lampoon brought down the Bourbon kings and the Romanov tzars. In our own time, mockery became Sarah Palin's greatest liability, but it, could have done the same to Obama had the Right known how to deploy it, sadly we didn't."

"Unable to access twitter & facebook has been the worst part of the imposed internet silence. I realise that I get most of my news from twitter, from trusted 'sources' whose links I follow - and although I could occasionally access twitter on my 'phone I could not open the links - bah humbug! Facebook silence has meant I could not follow the progress of a poorly relative plus I have been down on both my home gossip and - along with the loss of twitter - my political campaigning!"

I kind of have to give them credit for staying true to their sound, though (and really, I never had a problem with that stupid, ugly, joyous sound). This concludes the white rapper trilogy portion of the list."

"Ultimately, the stereotypical trap that AVATAR not only doesn’t fall into but outright rejects is the “vanishing Indian” myth. In the typical “white man makes a better Indian than the Indians do” story, whatever victory is accomplished by the white man’s cultural shift is soaked in sorrow because we know how it all ends – it’s a victory in battle but not in war."
"Keeping up with music trends isn’t always pleasant business. Sometimes all you hear is garbage, every once in a while something truly great comes along. But mostly you may hear a glimpse of something great, however it’s masked, drowned and buried in excessive and purposeful repetition, over-use of bass or a certain, specific sound. Yes, I’m talking to you Dubstep. So why bother you may ask?"

It does not quite deliver what Ben Franklin meant by his aphorism ”Do well by doing good,” but if you have an SAT or ACT or GRE or other sort of standardized test coming up on which your vocabulary will be tested, it might fit the bill."
"Asleep in the Light is a song that should be banned in any church that has sold out with out reaching out.

"I don’t care what anyone tells you: sitting at a computer for 8 hours is a major energy drain, particularly when you’re under the weather and a little tired to begin with. By the time I’d left work and walked/rode home (jumping over puddles as I went), I had about enough energy left to eat some string cheese, greek yogurt and vegetable chips (I should clarify, Mike was hanging out with a few guy friends and ate dinner/left before I got home) while watching last night’s episode of Castle followed by Thursday’s Parks and Rec. Eventually I scaled Mount Staircase and have since been sitting in my office catching up on my other love: Studio255 (my freelance stationery company). I cannot thank my clients enough for their patience while I finished up closing on the new house, painted and moved in. Hopefully things will balance out soon so I can keep Studio255 and getting the house in order both moving along nicely – ideally leaving me a few ‘spare’ minutes to get a vegetable garden up and running."
"And there I was, finally in a familiar space. I knew how to do this. This was a rhythm I had down, and the only multitasking I had to do was breathing as I pulled myself through the water. At least for this moment, things are indeed getting back to normal."
"Downfall symbolises the Manichean view of the case: good versus evil, light versus darkness. According to Downfall, no person who defended Sheridan did so for good reason: they were either stunningly naive or self-serving plotters. Those who testified against him, even those who were paid to do so, were credible, believable even. No middle ground, no shades of grey are even considered."
"Finally, rinse and repeat five thousand times. Proliferate franchised, chartered McSchools with each classroom in each McSchool teaching the same thing on the same day in exactly the same way. So, for the math lesson on the formula of a line, you only need develop it once. But you download it in Power Point on the assigned day so the room monitors, i.e., the “teachers,” know what bullets to read. Now repeat this for every lesson in every course in every school, every day. In biology, chemistry, geometry, history, English, Spanish, indeed, all of a K-12 curriculum. Develop the lesson literally once, but distribute and reuse it thousands of times with low-cost proctors doing the supervision. The cost is infinitesimal making the profit potential astronomical."
"When I asked the manager about the origins of Bistecca alla Fiorentina and of it being a specific breed of Italian bovine, he shook his head and said that no, he didn’t think so. Damn. I had hoped—just a little."

"There is no rush to the vast majority of genealogical research. Take your time. Make certain you really do have the same person in place A that you think you have in place B. Ask yourself if that family connection is logical and does that \"far-fetched\" tale really make sense. You can also reduce the chance of this sort of mistake by using online trees as clues, not grabbing the first match that appears \"close,\" and giving yourself some \"soak time\" between making a conclusion and using it to begin more research."
"So, let's go ahead and get to today's outfit... These pieces were collected from H&M, Charlotte Russe, Forever 21, and Nordstrom. If you recall, I've not yet included a dress in any of the FFS posts, which is precisely why you're seeing one now :)"
"Whether in the Temporary or the Permanent search industry meeting a lot of candidates is a critical success factor. Recruiters are sent hundreds of resumes weekly and dig into profiles on a regular basis. The information provided may come in several avenues, both public and private and the information is protected by a legislated privacy act accordingly. In Alberta and British Columbia this is often referred to as FOIPP Act (Freedom of Information and Privacy Protection Act), and is fairly progressive compared to many other regions of Canada."

"I stood in front of my fabric stash shelf looking for the perfect fabric for two projects I want to get started on, thinking about the qualities that would make said fabric perfect. I looked and looked, searched and searched and then came to a horrifying conclusion: \"I do not have enough of any suitable fabric for EITHER of the projects!\" How can this be???? Surely, this is stuff that happens to other people, to strangers, but not to ME!"
"“Fairy Tail” is the perfect manga for people of all ages – it mixes action, adventure, comedy, and fantasy in a way that keeps you either laughing the characters antics or growling at them for being so darn stupid. It actually happens to be one of my favorite mangas (and now has to be crossed off my ‘M’ Stands for Manga list). The plot follows celestial wizard Lucy who wants to join the Fairy Tail, a guild for the most powerful wizards. But instead, her ambitions land her in the clutches of a gang of unsavory pirates led by a devious magician. Her only hope is Natsu, a strange boy she happens to meet on her travels. Natsu’s not your typical hero – but he just might be Lucy’s best hope. (Taken/paraphrased from Mangafox.com)"
"It was more like a slow burn than a spark, but I’d say I started working in earnest on the project in June 2009, researching possible science projects and brainstorming plot complications and scenes. I turned in my final draft in February 2011. The book was released in January 2012."

"The children almost all volunteered to take part in the oratory at the Rostra next week. You are invited to attend! It will be held in the classroom. Warning: If you are made nervous or queasy by children standing on tables, please bring the appropriate sedatives for yourself. :) Below are the memory lines they chose to recite. You will find the words they're working on in their scrapbooks, or I'm printing them below. They do NOT need to memorize all of the poem in order to participate. Even one line is fine! I told them even one syllable is fine, actually. Encourage the children to recite only what they're really comfortable reciting -- we want this to be a very positive experience, and that means fewer lines is better, if more lines bring anxiety. Look for your child's name in the list below. If you and your child are not sure what you should be working on, please let me know.

Proverbs 24:17-22 (NKJV) instructs us to “…not rejoice when your enemy falls, And do not let your heart be glad when he stumbles; Lest the Lord see it, and it displease Him, And He turn away His wrath from him. Do not fret because of evildoers, Nor be envious of the wicked; For there will be no prospect for the evil man; The lamp of the wicked will be put out.” God has this guys…He is in control."

"After Norm MacDonald, arguably the greatest Weekend Update anchor to grace the SNL new desk, was unceremoniously canned by NBC, he spent a few years making movies that range from underrated (Dirty Work) to terrible (Screwed) before being picked up by ABC for three seasons of his own sitcom, Norm. Even with a The Drew Carey Show at the peak of its run as a lead-in, Norm never drew all that much in terms of ratings, a hint that MacDonald’s sensibility was a touch more suited to late night with its inherent weirdness. After Norm we got half a season of the soul-draining A Minute With Stan Hooper, and since 2002 Norm has had little in the way of film and TV parts, only briefly gracing the airwaves for his sporadic but justly legendary appearances on Late Night (and the Tonight Show) with Conan O’Brien and to deliver five minutes of brilliant anti-comedy at the Comedy Central Roast of his Dirty Work director Bob Saget."

"In the Tang dynasty (618 AD – 907 AD), tea leaves were steamed, pressed into brick form and let dry for easy storage. Brick tea was spread to Japan during this time by Buddhist monks. In modern times, only certain Pu-erh tea is processed using this method. During the Song dynasty (920 AD – 1279 AD), the Chinese started to process tea leaves in loose form as it is considered a better way to store refined tea leaves. Even to this day, loose form is still the preferred way of processing tea throughout the world."
"4. Energy cycles back and forth between my partner and myself when we are relaxed and connected and feeling the music. Kind of like sex, but actually less complex because the dance is a container for the energy without the machinations of romance, emotion and reflection clouding it up. I can totally see how partners can become infatuated (or furious) with one another during a tanda. A little example: in the beginning, tango was very challenging for B, and he was struggling and working really hard to get it right, after a few months of this, during practica one evening he finally really let go of thinking and just danced to the music, and I felt a huge shift and a wave of energy flowed from him into me. And I was like \"wow!!--what happened?\" and he answered, \"I just said 'screw it!' and let go of trying to do it right and just grooved\". We were only at the point of walking and doing the basic, but after this we took it to another level, and really started to have fun."

I had about two months of additional training time before the infomercial shoot date, so I decided to kick my training and diet into full gear. I ate only lean meats, eggs and vegetables four times a day. I exercised six days a week and often did double days. I would lift weights for an hour in the afternoon and then swim for 30 minutes after weight training. I dropped down to just under 6% body fat, and it looked awesome! However, I found myself getting weaker and weaker athletically speaking as my roadmap to getting ripped progressed. I was basically on a bodybuilder’s diet, which was pretty much all protein and little-to-no carbohydrates. I found myself lifting less and less weight and being fatigued more quickly in the pool as my body fat dropped."

"Business ethics can be examined from various perspectives, including the perspective of the employee, the commercial enterprise, and society as a whole. Very often, situations arise in which there is conflict between one and more of the parties, such that serving the interest of one party is a detriment to the other(s). For example, a particular outcome might be good for the employee, whereas, it would be bad for the company, society, or vice versa. Some ethicists see the principal role of ethics as the harmonization and reconciliation of conflicting interests."

At the time, someone I knew was fighting cancer, a life of illness, treatment, remission, illness, treatment, remission, then illness again. I also knew someone who had suffered severe brain damage. In both cases, these were people I cared about, but both of them were loved by people I loved. In both cases, it was wrong to give up hope, but in some ways hope was more difficult than acceptance. Since I didn't want to write anything too specifically about these people, I chose to explore the dilemma by writing about a missing person."

However, many of my friends have at one point or another.

"Most recipes I could find for guava cakes used guava nectar, but I did find one that uses guava paste as a layer in the middle of the cupcakes. I used my go-to cream cheese frosting from Baked Explorations, I decorated some with a swirl of guava paste and some just piped with frosting. The cupcakes turned out pretty good, the cake is quite dense, like a pound cake which isn't my favourite (I'm more of a sponge cake type of girl), but my husband loved it. I don't think I cut the guava paste thin enough so it didn't quite melt into the ribbons I had envisioned, but it tasted great nonetheless. Next time I'll use a more standard yellow cake recipe and slice the guava paste as thin as I possibly can."

"(2) Perhaps it was because of the attachment I developed for Dr L, and therefore they did not want to risk me developing the same kind of feelings for another female psychologist. Initially I worried this could happen in my own mind, as I do seem to develop an attachment to female staff members (teachers, doctors, other professionals), as well as Dr L, my old GP before I moved here who was especially supportive during the darkest times of my mental health and especially when mum was ill. I was horrified when I saw her at the gym once with me stuck in the outside pool, and she comes strolling along and starts swimming like an Olympic athlete, I practically ran from the pool inside when I knew she was swimming in the opposite direction! As for Ms Therapist, I admit there have been no feelings of affection for her at all, she does somewhat remind me of Dr L in terms of looks, but she is more talkative and open in conversations and I see her as a psychologist and nothing more. I suspect my fascination and attachment with Dr L was always partly to do with looking for a substitute when my mother was ill! I guess it is the same for CC, she is female (in case you did not know!) but I have not experienced any feelings towards her, I see her as just someone who supports me and perhaps as a friend."

"Loneliness experienced in all our human glory is a debilitating sense of loss because when we are trying to see ourselves reflected in the eyes of others, we are also trying to love ourselves…. only the love is illusory. That is why when we are not able to be with others we cannot feel the fullness of real love in ourselves. Loneliness is a human abstraction related to the idealisation of a false love, but paradoxically in its real nature is the release of spiritual aloneness. Loneliness experienced from the position of self-awareness is aloneness which opens the mystical doorway into a greater awareness of self, and therefore the ability to love oneself for who one really is."

"Specifically, under 35 U.S.C. § 363, the international filing date of a PCT application is also the U.S. filing date for the corresponding national stage application. 35 U.S.C. § 363 (1984); see also Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP) § 1893.03(b) (8th Ed. including May 2004 revisions) (\"It should be borne in mind that the filing date of the international application is also the filing date for the national stage application.\"). Thus, the ’595 patent’s U.S. filing date is November 26, 1993, the filing date of the PCT application. Because the ’094 patent is entitled to priority back to the ’595 patent’s U.S. filing date, the ’094 patent’s priority date under 35 U.S.C. § 120 as well as its term calculation date under 35 U.S.C. § 154(a)(2) is at least November 26, 1993. In other words, the ’094 patent, which specifically references the ’595 patent and thus satisfies the requirements of 35 U.S.C. § 120 and 37 C.F.R. § 1.78(a), is entitled to effectively the same date as the original PCT"

"Then I tweaked the neckline. The neckline (really wishing I had captured a \"pre\" image of this) did not lay nicely because the slit, while obviously intended to butt nicely, instead gaped awkwardly with unsightly draglines. So I united the portion of the slit that is below the sheer lace (you can make out the stitches if you click on the close-up view of the neckline... this is where the aforementioned subtlety comes into play). Then I finished-off the rest of the slit with a closure of two buttons and elastic loops. It's much more wearable now."

So this week, I'm trying a new strategy. Last night, we ended up walking 50 minutes total (did about 2 miles), and the pain while walking was no worse than having done just 20 minutes at the time (the pain over night and this morning though? Yowza.). SO...I'm going to try completely resting it today (will do my trainer workout tonite which keeps me off my foot for the most part), and then tomorrow do another 2 or so miles, as far as I feel I can go. I'm hoping that this might strengthen it a bit more. Or it could be a huge fail. Ya never know until you try.

There’s a fee at the beginning for the medical exam and lab work ($250?), and then there’s the product. The more you are on, the more you pay, obviously. It’s approximately $2.50 a product.

"A few of the comments on the Imperi-Ale 5.0 from the not exactly naïve quaffers in the room: a mildly sweet front end with a touch of melon flavor… A clean transition to a gentle bitterness… Moves towards a citrus/spicy note nurtured by a warming bready-toasty character of malt…. Finishes with a crisp melon punch and caramel sweetness, capped by a touch of lingering bitterness…"
"The fourth film I seriously considered was Strangers On A Train. In this one, Guy meets a mysterious man on a train trip who offers a bizarre bargain: he’d kill Guy’s wife in exchange for Guy doing away with the man’s father, thereby solving both of their problems. Guy says no, but the man carries out his end anyway soon thereafter, by killing his wife. While the setup has some elements of horror, this movie ultimately becomes a thriller/blackmail film."

"The J Paul Getty Museum has commissioned four new sculptures by Tim Hawkinson, and, for the first time on the west coast, his gargantuan Überorgan, 2001 is on display. Using an actual organ and a variety of ducts and pipes as a conveyance of massive sound, the flatulent and moaning piece is loud, overwhelming and completely obnoxious. It is also fantastic. From the intestinal tubes and belching aortas in the Getty’s entrance hall, you proceed into the collections looking for quiet, struck with wonder yet fleeing a magnificent creature that woke you up."
"Let me start with the negatives. This film is shot entirely in black and white, which is a nice stylistic decision. However, in the age of HDTV and widescreen sets, the fact that it is shot in an old-school 4:3 aspect ratio is a bit annoying for somebody watching the film today. This is, however, something that is just me being a nitpicky prick, so let us ignore that I even brought it up."
"The handwritten text is a rule-- I almost always do it, and I can't escape my thoughts. One key to understanding the text is that it's usually like you said, Amy, it's like a family album-- it tells us why a picture was taken at that exact moment, it tells what was thought to be the story's end at that moment or other key fact that was in our minds when I came to make a picture."

"The environment Dequan will face in elementary and high schools is defined by its ignorance. Children hate because they have been taught to by the adults in their lives and because they don’t know any other way to behave. In Missouri and Tennessee, there are bills that have been introduced which prohibit any discussion of LGBT topics for grades K-8. They’ve been aptly titled the, “Don’t Say Gay” laws and they have the potential to hurt thousands of young boys and girls in those two states. Simply put, it is state-sponsored discrimination against minors. What does it tell a 7 or 8 year old, who is just beginning to form a conception of the world around him or her, that there are certain people that you just don’t talk about? This is ignorance as academic policy, in the same vein as abstinence only education, but worse. At least with the abstinence only movement, you were attacking a sexual act. With the Don’t Say Gay legislation, you directly attack the individual."

"3. Education. We’d give a few million to St. Matthew Catholic School in Phoenix, where I did my JV year, which works with the very-poor children of immigrants in Phoenix. A few million to the Boys and Girls club, and a few million to Most Holy Rosary School and Bishop Ludden High School back home. We’d remember to think locally, too, and give a million each to the poorer Catholic Schools here in Tucson, and maybe some to the public schools servicing low-income students. I’d also like to to work out an investment so we could set up a grant to be paid from the interest. The grant would be specifically to educate children living in poverty – to encourage solutions in educating them."

"Underworld begins where we are left off at the end of Abandon, Pierce is now ruling as Queen of the underworld with John, having just escaped a desperate and personal attack from the Furies. Her safety is still in jeopardy though, which leaves the reader constantly questioning who can really be trusted. Pierce also has some unfinished business left with the living and therefore must return to keep those she's left behind safe, a task that leaves her relationship with John conflicted. This book has definitely added new darker elements to the story with new hilarious characters along with mysterious developments into certain pasts that'll leave you questioning EVERYTHING!"

"She's doing well. Mostly a happy, content baby. People comment on her pleasant disposition. But of course that isn't always the case. She cries, and fusses, gets frustrated and angry. Sleep still is hard on me. We've put a futon mattress on the floor of her room - an attempt to slowly transition her out of our bed, while allowing me (or my dh someday) to still sleep with her. It's only been a few nights. And some of those nights I've brought her back to my bed because it's so much more comfortable, and if she's not going to sleep well, I might as well at least be comfortable in between the wakings!"

I find Polke at the heart of a world that I still struggle to understand, the spiritual and earthy store of German art, a zany place that produces some of the best artwork in the world."

One of the biggest annoyances when it comes to language and communicating is when someone doesn’t know a word and won’t just ask what it means so we can move on with the conversation. I’ve had the bizarre experience though of people questioning me and even having the gall to make fun of me when I use a large word (there you go again using your $5 words!). It’s really all I can do to keep from laughing and it makes me feel like I’m in the twilight zone. Mind you I don’t even think I have a large vocabulary. I often feel like Marilyn in the Munsters tv show if anyone remembers that. Try to gain knowledge and use it and others see you as a freak!"

"The irony of all this of course, is that very little people actually seem to care.

I know 20% cuts have been imposed on the Home Office, but is this really the right thing to do? From an ethical view point at least, most certainly not. Also, with less accountability to the public, how can we guarantee the safety of the public from abuse of power, or even regarding witness statements?

This is an anamorphic projection of a skull; if the viewer stands to the extreme right of the painting and looks across the panel, this object becomes foreshortened and is clearly seen to be a skull. Possibly Holbein painted it in this peculiar fashion, hidden but in plain view, to suggest that a reminder of death is always present in the midst of power and opulence, the skull being a symbol of mortality."

The French are also unusually interested in the plight of Australia's Aborigines. Many is the time I have been quizzed by locals interested in the Aboriginal story. If the French media dedicate any air time or column space at all to Australia, it is more often than not to explore the Aboriginal predicament. Samson & Delilah will doubtless go some way to feeding that fascination."

Keep the walls close."
"However, I always find it strange when directors cast non-language-speaking actors in prominent roles, and then have them dubbed over. It doesn’t seem to happen that often anymore, but I have seen easily a half-dozen European films from the 60’s and 70’s that were cast this way. I’ve always wondered how this works for a director. For example, Burt Lancaster and Alain Delon are the primary characters in The Leopard, and neither speaks a bit of Italian. The dubbing is quite obvious, and also rather discombobulating at first. What was the reasoning behind casting these particular actors? Did Lancaster and Delon have a certain look that made their lack of Italian language skills a secondary consideration? It’s true that both men fit their roles perfectly, but as with foreign films that have been dubbed for the international market, I always feel that there is something particular missing when the actor’s physical presence doesn’t match his dialog. When films are subtitled, it may be difficult at times to take in both the translated dialog and the visual components, but at least the originality of the actor’s delivery and individual voice is retained. In this case, watching Lancaster was a bizarre transaction – an actor speaking in English, then dubbed over in Italian, and then subtitled again in English."

If she wanted to she could have been a model, but the idea never crossed her mind.The older ones on the reservation called her Joelanar, meaning kindred. They believed the wolf and her had been mates in another life, and that was why he refused to leave her side. She didn’t know if she believed that, but even she recognized that they shared an uncanny sense of understanding. He had already lived longer then the average life span of a house pet, and didn’t show any signs of slowing down. Like her his true age was a mystery."

"Raising free-thinking entrepreneurs is such an incredible benefit to Unschooling. Our children do not hear that they can have their own businesses \"someday.\" They have them NOW. They have such a head-start in comparison to children in school when it comes to living in the real world, pursuing their passions and making money from them. Our family has many businesses at this point in our life with multiple streams of income. Our children have learned so much about marketing and business through living a connected life rich with resources to nurture their interests. I want my children to know that they can always have whatever they want in life, but sometimes they need to get creative to manifest what they want. This includes the desire to help others in various ways. We recently wanted to buy my parents a Vitamix blender and we pulled together as a family to figure out how we could make money to do that for them."
"Tunisia’s secularist will look with anxiety to an Egypt which has turned further to the right. Coupled with Ennahdha’s moderate rhetoric, secularist alarmism has mostly fallen on deaf ears in Tunisia. Most Tunisians simply do not see their country following the path of Iran or Saudi Arabia, and the Algerian civil war – with its complex moral narrative – is already a decade in the past. An Egypt which has turned toward the extreme would provide secularists with a narrative that could be a call to action among secular sympathizers in the country."

Still, she accepted his invitation to come to Las Vegas to see him at the Sands hotel, where he was filming Oceans 11 and performing at night with the Rat Pack consisting of Dean Martin, Sammy Davis jr., Joey Bishop and Peter Lawford, brother-in-law of JFK (he was married to JFK’s sister Patricia). It was there that she met JFK in February of 1960. Judith claimed not to know who he was or that he was running for President of the United States. Apparently spending three hours a day getting ready didn’t leave much time for reading newspapers of newsmagazines. Although there were other people at the table, Judith wrote that JFK spent all his time focused on her. “It was as if every nerve and muscle in his whole body was poised at attention. As I was to learn, Jack Kennedy was the world’s greatest listener.”"

"The artistically fascinating aspect of Hogancamp's doll house is that his particular appropriation of this societal devil incarnate or Platonic ideal of national sin is communicated through a media that is screaming out kitch, but the episodes of Hogan's Heroes he storyboards and photographs are dead serious. A working-class folk artist, it is reasonable to speculate that Hogancamp's educational exposure to sophisticated treatments of the WWII narrative has been minimal. Be this as it may, his use of GI Joe action figures and Barbie dolls reflects his very modest economic means when it comes to procuring the necessary material supplies for his artistic expression. That he is able to overcome the popular perception of these objects as automatically signifying nothing more than toys for kids - without a trace of irony - is of itself testament to the power of sincerity in art."

But still, it wasn’t working. It was all because major of my funds were being spent on hotel bills where I’d spend the night. I actually thought of camping out during the course of the trip but I knew what December has to offer in Rajasthan.

In keeping with our institutional belief that knowledge is empowerment, TL&D seeks to establish itself as an authority in these areas and contribute to the dissemination of ideas and promotion of free thinking in the developing world."

"But the laugh will be on them — if not for their own families, then for their children’s. The feminist policies that were put in place to help women flourish outside the home have suffocated men’s opportunities for economic self-sufficiency. In short, men’s desire to be good workers and family providers has been undermined. This is more than unfortunate; it is a loss of catastrophic proportions, for it is men’s consistent, full-time, year-round work that women depend on in order to live that ever-coveted “balanced life.” What too many women don’t understand (because they’ve been unduly influenced by feminist groupthink) is that male nature is ultimately beneficial to them, for women continue to put family — not career — at the center of their lives and are thus dependent on men to pick up the slack at the office."

"Although Dan Clowes writes and draws all his own stories, the real art of this piece is how the hell this middle-aged man managed to nail the thoughts and characterisations of these two teenagers so well! The dialogue is spot-on, and the relationship between the girls and their ‘friends’ is agonisingly real. Everyone goes through that awkward 'no longer a kid, not yet an adult' phase, and I guess that's why this book is so easy to relate to. It's one of those stories where, on the face of it, little happens, yet dig a little deeper and it's pretty much the whole of life, wrapped up in eighty odd pages."

"The message of How Evil Works: Understanding and Overcoming the Destructive Forces that are Transforming America by David Kupelian ($26.00, Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon and Schuster) is stark and simple. There is evil in the world and the author believes that your defense against it is the belief in a higher power and the rules for a moral life that are found in the Old and New Testaments. Though Kupelian does base his book on fundamental religious values, the fact is that many Americans do believe in them even as they see forces at work in the nation to destroy it. The value of the book is the way Kupelian confronts and answers questions many Americans are asking. Why are New Age religions becoming popular along with atheism? Why do so many celebrities and public figures that “have it all” end up self-destructing? Why are Big Lies more believable than little ones? Why are boys doing worse in schools today than girls? Why do we think that the only treatment for mental, emotional, and spiritual problems like anger and depression are drugs? These and many other comparable questions about our society and how it is changing for the worse are addressed. You do not have to be “religious” to be concerned and the book is a tad preachy, but it is also a valuable guide to the evil forces at work in our society today."

"Tuesday morning - Same red light, although the light dusting of rain onto the dirt ground and absence of rosy cheeked urchins off to school to get on their computers and post Facebook updates that so and so is a skank, I've decided to place my entire happiness on the ability of my sports team to move a piece of leather around a piece of greenery once owned by Aboriginal elders better than 22wo other randomly assorted strangers who have inverted values to my own team. It might be unromantic to describe an AFL Preliminary final in such terms, but I've just been speaking to my unromantic auntie in Scotland. She lives in a street where a romantic gesture is sending a txt msg that doesn't contain a swear word or an insult, so explaining the beauty of an alien Australian based sport down a phone line isn't going to be easy. I say this because 1ne of my teams elder statesmen is on the cover of the newspaper making 1ne of those old persons determined fists photographers have them make when they are close to death or unlikely to be in a physical condition to pose for an action shot. A woman at work walks past later in the day eating 1ne of the morning muffins so generously provided by corporate pseudo generosity, and says 1ne of those strange glib work phrases people feel obliged to say to pass the time. Something like makes you think. I don't know what makes me think these days, but the posed machinations of an elderly gent probably don't do it for me. I drove past a homeless guy on the way home last night - he was propped up in the rain against an ATM machine, his tattered rags the kind of tattered rags other tattered rag wearers would point to and say damn those rags are tattered, his eyes shut, his silhouette a despairing shadow of venom, despair and cheap wine in a cask. Did that make me think? I don't know - maybe. Maybe for as long as it took for the lights to change. That's the usual pattern of attention for the meandering suburban driver. Attention spans last only as long as 1ne colour of light stays constant, or as long as the patter of the radio isn't too inane or bland to make you press the off button...complex social issues? I can't even work my CD changer..."

Then I would add Jimmy Stewart to the mix. I’m huge fan of his. He’s that classic movie star that played the everyday man so well. Also, I think he and Jesus would hit it off. Well, there likely old friends already, right? Finally, Annie Leibovitz would receive an invite as well. I’m a wedding photographer as well as an actor. So, Annie Leibovitz is a sort of hero of mine in the photography realm. Plus, she could take some kick-ass pics of this outstanding dinner that I’m sure I’ll need proof of when I tell people about."

"AW the Alchemist has been criticized over the years for honing young talent instead of shipping in “experienced” and “made” footballers. Today’s win will vindicate our faithful manager. Arsenal FC can boast of being financially stable even if we were on a barren spell for almost 6 years. The major reason why Arsenal hasn’t won anything is that there have been injuries to key players when their “experience” was needed to see us through. Things have been a lot different this season because of the sufficient depth in the squad."

"As a full-time father, I have the rare opportunity to be immersed in all of this and to be on hand for almost everything that happens to them. While this positionality comes with its ups and downs, the cumulative effect of my experiences with them has been one of great joy. By sending Polly and Pip to preschool I would be giving up some of this, and that is not an idea I relish. More importantly, sending them to preschool effectively outsources all the fun stuff about being a parent while requiring me to spend much of my time playing the less enjoyable roles of nag and chaperone. If the roles were reversed and I got to play with my kids, read books to them, or do art projects with them while someone else cooked, cleaned, and made sure they got out of the door on time, then I would sign up for that immediately. But that’s not how preschool works and so for me, sending my kids to one doesn’t make sense."

We were cued for applause, saw Jimmy get his makeup touch-ups (Obama either had his makeup done backstage or was going for more of the natural look), and bore witness to all that goes behind putting on a show. Well worth all the waiting in line. Seniors were given preference for tickets for the show and luckily, or unluckily depending on how you look at it, I am a senior and was a selected! However, this also meant waiting in line for 2+ hours and calling my boss to tell him I would be late to work to get a ticket.

It saves on wrapping, time and effort, and $10 itself may not be very much, but the recipients are thrilled to add it to their stash."
"In many ways, this unassuming and largely overlooked compilation does a better job of exploring the more obscure side of Ardent's late-sixties and seventies output than the much more high profile Thank You Friends comp.

They sought other Yugoslavs, others with whom they could speak their language and relax their struggles to become American.

Nearly a year has passed since the landing of his \"spacecraft,\" as people had called it, and his name and face have spread throughout the West coast, along with rumors of a hefty reward.

"Sure, I will freely admit that I think it's good for our national consciousness to have this terrorist eliminated. We've been dragging around this heavy weight for the last ten years; pushing the search for Bin Laden to the back of our minds, and trying the forget that he was the reason we removed the Taliban, bombed and killed hundreds, if not thousands, of civilians in Afghanistan, and somehow tried to legitimize our attack and occupation of Iraq because of either the ties to Bin Laden and Al Qaeda, or because we were worried that Saddam Hussein was going to become another terrorist (I could never exactly figure out their excuse - I don't think I'm alone on this one). Now, at last, the dark cloud has parted, and we can finally say - as a country - that we killed the man responsible for the attacks on the World Trade Center. It is sort of a national catharsis that I think we're in desperate need of, and I think it actually might have an amazing effect on our economy, the salty political discourse, as well as our foreign policy."
"AF: There were many inspirations while writing The Hunt, but I feel particularly indebted to Edward Hopper, a painter who once stated that he had a “propensity for solitude.” His work Morning Sun was a painting I returned to time and again, especially during dry spells in my writing. Something about the stark loneliness of the woman on the bed despite (or because of) the sunlight captured the solitude and isolation with which I wanted to fill the pages of this book. I feel indebted to this painting for the way it spoke of loneliness in a manner that was both nuanced and powerful. Hopefully, this layered kind of loneliness came through in the protagonist Gene of The Hunt."

"Ghee. Chickenandcowlady has been generously supplying me with ghee. I am MOST grateful. I am not even sure how to say how much I appreciate or express how much I love the stuff. But, curiosity and a sense of independence grabbed hold of me, and I decided that I should try to make it myself. Now, I have no cow, so I knew there was no way I was going to duplicate what I'd been used to. I purchased butter in bulk (4lbs) at Sams, and followed a ghee recipe that CACL had sent me a link to. I think she sent me the recipe, not so much for me to make it, but so I'd understand the process, and what happened as butter was transformed to ghee. (chickenandcowlady is entirely to long, and it ticks my spell checker off every time I type it, so hence forward, CACL is it.)"

"I taught high school and young adult literature for years. One of my favorites is a series written by Ellen Emerson White (using the pseudonym of Zack Emerson). It is the Echo Company series and deals with the Vietnam War. I have read and reread the series, but I never tire of it. Another of those I like is Julius Lester’s novelized version of Shakespeare’s Othello. Lester uses many of the original lines while creating a unique tale that brings tears to ones’ eyes. I would also include Adeline Yen Mah’s Chinese Cinderella. It is the true story of a childhood forgotten."

"Alex Abella, the author of Soldiers of Reason, is a Cuban-American living in Los Angeles who has written several well-received action and adventure novels set in Cuba and a less successful nonfiction account of attempted Nazi sabotage within the United States during World War II. The publisher of his latest book claims that it is “the first history of the shadowy think tank that reshaped the modern world.” Such a history is long overdue. Unfortunately, this book does not exhaust the demand. We still need a less hagiographic, more critical, more penetrating analysis of RAND’s peculiar contributions to the modern world."

When I mean refreshing, I don't mean cheap lager to wash down pizza with, I'm talking about the that unsweetened ice tea in the middle of summer feeling. For a beer with a name like this, it looked a bit cloudy and tasted more tart than I'd expect of a pilsner. There must have been some of that lemon and orange zest in this, which made me not like it as much as I could have. I was really looking for a more clean lightly carbonated beer with a bit of sweetness without the zest."

"Henry M. Paulson, Jr., the Secretary of the Treasury under George W.

The former CEO of Goldman Sachs had assumed the job in 2006. Little did he know he would be at the center of “a perfect storm” to save the nation’s and the global economy. By all outsider accounts, that’s exactly what he did with the support of Congress and others in government, not the least of whom was President Bush who Paulson obviously respects. What makes this book so interesting is his candid story of the people and the politics that made it possible to draw back from the brink.

The hard part is even though it looks like we'll be in Tahoe for awhile, I know that we're not going to be here forever so we don't want to buy a bunch of furniture for this place that might not work when we move. At the same time, I think this new apartment has some great potential so I want to make it look nice. The top priorities at the moment are: getting some patio furniture (preferably a table, chairs, and some chaise lounges would be great!), buying a new grill (we sold ours when we moved to South Carolina because our apartment didn't allow them), getting a new kitchen table (we sold our kitchen table when we left Colorado because we didn't have space for it in the downstairs apartment), and possibly putting up some new curtains. I'm scouring Pinterest for some good DIY ideas and we'll hopefully be doing some shopping over the next few weeks. Once we get everything moved in, I'll definitely be sharing some pictures!"

"It’s sad how we live in a world that just seems to zoom by, and we get so caught up with everything that’s going on– work, making money, greed, self-interest, education, wars, poverty, campaign, global warming, even the hunger games (ok, that was unnecessary)– that we really forget to stop and analyze what it is we have, and how we have and are slowly changing; the new factors that influence and play roles in our lives, new people that we meet, and even those that are now gone. To think back to years before– on this same day– and try to remember what you did, who you were, and even who you thought you were going to be. Have things played out the way you expected them to? Have you diverted from your path? have you lost sight of who you were or what you once dreamed of?"
"Back to more artistic pursuits though with the 1932 conversion of the venue into a full-time movie theatre, Cinéma Apollo, which was first renovated in 1952 ahead of being demolished and rebuilt once again in 1972 as a multi-screen complex: Cinéma Ariel. Fifteen or so years later, the complex was taken over by the ever-expanding Union Générale Cinématographique group, more commonly known in France as UGC. And, in 1997, the building was modernised once again, resulting in the fifteen-screen UGC Ciné Cité with which people are familiar today, the main façade of which also shows tell-tale signs of its theatre and concert-hall past!"

It was the stuff of which things are made, the beet of the tree was formed out of existence. The beet of the tree, the fences of the parc, the seat, the teneous grass of the lawn, all this had disappeared. The diversity of things, their own character was only an illusion, a little varnish. The varnish was gone, what was left were monstrous, weak heaps, chaotic and nude. Of a terrifying, obscene nudity."

If you can hold it comfortably for 10 seconds it's about the right weight.” It wasn't exactly comfortable, but I persevered."

"At 33 minutes, Alice Guy’s The Birth, the Life and the Death of Christ was a healthy length for the time, and probably more epic in feel for its 1906 French audience than it is for us. We might focus on its limitations: the fixed camerawork, typical of the era, and the deliberate stagecraft, which makes The Birth seem like a theatre production with a lens for an audience. God help the viewer who doesn’t know the story going in, since Guy bypasses considerable and complicated details to tell the story in pantomime. Worse, she makes Jesus boring. We never see his fabled throwdown with the moneylenders, or his admonition against those who would throw stones. In the absence of any dramatic tension (we all know how this ends), isn’t it the writer and/or director’s interpretation of Jesus that makes a film about him interesting? Guy, however, is content to depict—and the man she depicts is one-dimensional even by mytho-heroic standards."

I had read too much of it all, with its facile repetitions of brand names and parking-lot angst.

I would take every class I ever wanted to take, learn as much as I possibly could, become as \"well-rounded\" as they get, if it were something I could feasibly do. But I can't. I should go back. I will go back. But I need to make some sort of decision soon about what I will do once I'm back. What classes will I take? What degree will I pursue? What is it that I really want out of life???

She would exclaim with pride over your drawings, even if they were merely scribbles to everyone else. Most of all, she believed in your dreams, and she taught you to believe in them. If you needed a hug, a hand to hold, a pat on the back, a shoulder to cry on, an encouraging word, or a kick in the behind, Mam-Maw provided it. The phrase \"all things to all people\" was made for her."

I told her if her tummy stopped hurting we would try to go, and a short time later she insisted she felt better. So off we went with the promise to tell me if she started feeling bad again."

He drives a Yukon just because he doesn't give a crap about cars. My cousin which is his daughter drives a new 2007 BMW. Recently he bought a brand new Mastercraft x30 paid in cash on the spot.

"I know a whole family who operates like this. They blame and shame and tear down but never stop to see the hideousness of their own behavior. The son held a grudge towards his parents for favoring his little sister, something he felt set him up for a life of failures. This lead to several, years long, estrangements between him and his parents. They’d say something he didn’t like, and he’s cease all contact with them for years. I simply could not “get it” until I spoke to his parents during one of these estrangement periods. His parents told me stories of his lifelong habit of lying, his inability to keep a job, and about the time, when he was 19 or 20, when he came home from work late at night and woke his father up several times in a row, so they told him to move out. That had happened 25 years prior! Yes, I did have an “aha moment” about the son’s behavior at that point. It had been modeled for him all of his life. I have seven kids and I have been awakened more than once by one coming home late at night. My response was always, “Thank you,God! They are home and safe.” Then I went back to sleep. Sadly, narcissists do not learn to forgive, and let go, and move on, nor do they want to learn."

We are in an identical motel room, I think it is actually the room next door to the one we had last year, we ate an identical breakfast at the same Denny's restaurant (waffles. Geekygirl actually had waffles for 4 of the 6 meals we ate on the trip!) and spent another beautiful day at the aquarium. We dined at the same Mexican restaurant we went to last year with the rest of my co-workers, and again I got up at 4am to catch the bus to my relay race starting point, wondering again what on earth possessed me to sign up for this venture."

"Britt is a great deal more straightforward. A former burglar turned straight under Hank's influence (and that of his girlfriend Katie (Laura Allen), whose own attitude towards Britt's criminal past is sometimes disturbingly ambivalent), Britt starts the season as Hank's sidekick and spends it coming into his own, developing his PI skills and his understanding of Hank's limitations and fatal flaws. Despite his criminal past, Britt is sweet, lovable, and always ready with a joke, and Raymond-James could have coasted on these qualities. Instead he imbues Britt with intelligence and a bit of a dark side. He doesn't downplay Britt's lack of maturity, his recognition that he's done terrible things, or his capacity to do them in the future. Still, Britt is most interesting when he's playing opposite other characters. He and Katie are deeply in love, but the relationship has reached the point where it needs to either get a lot more serious or collapse under its own weight, and one of the season's central questions is which way it will fall. There's a lot standing in Britt and Katie's path--he's not quite ready for serious commitment, and she may not be able (or willing) to act as the calm moral center of his tumultuous life--but also a lot to be gained, and the uncertainty of their fate quickly becomes as nail-bitingly tense as the season's central mystery and Hank's journey towards both salvation and damnation. Britt's partnership with Hank, meanwhile, is the one entirely positive force in his life, and for Hank it is the one relationship where he is doing good rather than damage (for now). It's the crux of the characters' lives and of the show. With typical thoughtfulness (and demonstrating the sort of subtlety that probably got them canceled) Terriers's writers avoid the most common trope of partnership-based shows. Britt and Hank are not the most important people in each other's lives. There are people that they love more than each other and relationships that matter more to them than their partnership (I do not, for example, think that they make a particularly slashable couple, though I'm sure there are those who disagree). But that partnership is what makes all those other relationships possible, and when they falter--when Hank burns his last bridge with his ex-wife, or when Britt and Katie flame out--it's there to support them."
"The gay rights movement better pray that the Supreme Court takes the Prop 8 case and that they uphold Prop 8…because if they don’t, you will see a federal Constitutional Amendment defining marriage as a man and a woman clear both the House and the Senate without much debate and you will see it ratified by three-quarters of the states.

The gloomy, Gothic feel of the movie is reflected in the detailed production design: the jumbled, Edwardian mess of Eel Marsh House and the rain-lashed, grimy cottages and pub of Crythin Gifford. The Woman herself is a blurry, shadowy figure, often lurking at the edge of the frame, watching and waiting."

I use the invoice to track how many of the freebies go out, and if there are two or three going out in a cart, it throws my data off for that week. I track the freebies because it helps me to determine what kinds of stamps everyone likes so that I know what to put in the store for sale.

I'm going to see how next week goes and then decide whether to go back to the coupons or not. Help a girl out and double check your carts when you are getting your Manic Monday Freebie! It helps me to give you more of what you want! If you have any questions or concerns or issues about this, please email me and we will get it all sorted out!

"A couple of months ago a group of protesters went to the house of laws of Puerto Rico, they were there peacefully. They wanted to go and offer some solutions to what is going on in Puerto Rico, they wanted to read a manifest that would state how the country felt about the way things have been going. How were they received? They were violently kicked out of the building by force! The police force hit civilians indiscriminately, they didn’t care who they were hitting, these drones didn’t see a country crying out in pain, they saw something less then them. It was a horribly dark day in our history as far as I’m concerned. It was the day the government decided to do a show of force and scare its people. This is the kind of Puerto Rico I am living in. And this is why I need to see films like CHE and Romero. They let me see that I am not wrong in hating this kind of behavior from our government. When I see films that depict revolutionary leaders like Malcom X, Ernesto ‘Che’ Guevara, JFK, Martin Luther King, or even Ron Kovic (who’s story was brought to life in Oliver Stone’s Born on the Fourth of July) the question inevitably arises: where are our current revolutionary leaders?

But the resolution of this near-massacre, peaceable though it is, speaks volumes. It is not among the cops that cooler heads prevail—they’re ready to shoot. Nor is it the poor man who solves things, out-gunned though he is, in his last stand. No, events are calmed only by the arrival of the wealthy father, who, having discovered his daughter’s game, makes a mad dash in his (fancy) car to the site of the showdown."

I did just that after several episodes during season 2 and in particular I watched the deleted scenes after episode 8, “Performance Review.” Sometimes the best wisdom comes from the places we might easily overlook and I think it is easy to overlook the wisdom of Michael Scott. Here’s what Michael said in one deleted scene:"
"Weeelllllll, it wasn't long before we realized little Selam may not be car sick, but real sick. Stomach virus sick because we had to stop two more times to clean up, change, cover up, etc. It wasn't pretty. :) Poor little baby!! I can only imagine what the people driving behind us were thinking as we would veer to the side of the road to pull over so we could make sure she would choke on her vomit. Poor thing!! We quickly ran out of wipes, extra clothes and blankets. So much for super mom patting herself on the back for planning for every scenario. Serves me right for thinking I had it covered! We have never had this happen on a trip before, it was not fun! I wished more than one time on this trip that I could just zap us back home, we felt so bad for Selam. I even had to beg for wipes from a sweet mom at one of our unexpected gas station stops. This was after I literally washed Selam off in the restroom sink. The convenient store didn't have wipes for sale. Who would've thought? At our third unplanned stop another sweet man at a rest stop gave us a roll of paper towels. Note to self, when traveling with four kids plan for the absolute worst situation. :)"
"Basically all this is the long way around to saying I need to make a dungeon of great size and re-usability. I need something that I can run a thousand times with new players each time or any mix of people who have already been down into the depths and still have it be fun for everyone. I also want persistence so I can't just have a new dungeon every week. This means a Megadungeon, and not just any such place but one with a \"first level\" of immense size and a great number of entrances to all parts of it."

"In issuing Proclamation No. 1064, the government has taken the step necessary to open up the island to private ownership. This gesture may not be sufficient to appease some sectors which view the classification of the island partially into a forest reserve as absurd. That the island is no longer overrun by trees, however, does not becloud the vision to protect its remaining forest cover and to strike a healthy balance between progress and ecology. Ecological conservation is as important as economic progress."
"Another profound impact on my development happened in elementary school, when I was first introduced to the honor rule. I can clearly remember the chill that went down my spine when my adolescent mind grasped the significance of being on my own and responsible for myself. It was both scary and exhilarating at once and, in my own childish way, I knew that this was one of the most important lessons I would ever learn. It meant that I had to think for myself and take responsibility for my own actions. I had to take charge of my own mind so that I could be sure to do the right thing."
"The team of engineers and technicians at Hypertech R&D center in Memphis uses two computerized chassis dynamometers to develop the most powerful tuning programs possible. First they experimentally adjust the spark timing to obtain the highest torque and power readings at a given engine rpm. Then they adjust the air/fuel ratio to obtain the highest possible power and torque readings that an optimized air/fuel mixture can produce. After the spark timing and air/fuel ratio for that particular engine speed have been optimized, the rpm is increased to the next point and the entire procedure is repeated again. The process continues, point by point, up to the engine’s maximum speed. This technique is called experimental, point-by-point curve fitting. There is no more effective way to power tune an engine."
"I didn’t advocate federal mandates. I talked about it at a state level, finding a way — which included an escape clause that people didn’t have to buy it — finding a way to try to have people have insurance, particularly for wealthy people who are simply free-riding on local hospitals. But the fact is, it was a personal system, dramatically different than either Romneycare or the version Rick just discussed."
"Well, such psychological traits of the person in exclusive command do shed some light on the goings on. But should we not, as Marxists, try and move beyond the individual and grasp the class character and peculiar features of the regime as such as it evolves on the debris of a social democratic dispensation and takes a definite shape before our eyes? We have carefully investigated the collapse of the LF government and its implications for the left movement; should we not focus the spotlight now on the political formation that took its place?"
"I agree that a Referendum on splitting private debt from sovereign debt should be the first thing a new Govt organises. It is obscene that the people have had no say in being forced to pay for vast amounts of private debt. With a certain huge NO vote, at least the new Govt can go to Europe to negotiate."
"Today I saw a car crash."
"In general, yes it's true that a commuter who's on a train isn't driving, and therefore not polluting, using gasoline or running people over. But that's where the park-and-rides come in. If a commuter is only on your train for half their commute, they're still behind the wheel for the other half, polluting, burning gas and putting lives in danger the whole way. And if they then stay in the car for errands on the way home, that's more driving, plus they're shopping at car-oriented stores."

"The 9th affirms the denial of petitioner's claims. The petitioner plead to two counts of intentional murder, rather than aggravated murder, for which he received two terms, running consecutive, of at least 25 years each (a total of 50). The COA allowed petitioner to argue that counsel committed IAC in his plea and sentence. The 9th held that counsel was not ineffective in his advice regarding the plea, and the plea colloquy established a knowing plea. The petitioner knew the sentences could be run consecutive or concurrently. Counsel's argument at sentencing focusing on prior childhood abuse at the hands of a relative was strategic, even if it upset the family. The 9th also had an opportunity to consider the recent Martinez case concerning IAC of PCR counsel. The 9th broadened the COA to include a claim of IAC against PCR counsel, where petitioner asked for a limited remand to establish such ineffectiveness. The 9th denied the request, although admitting that in other instances, if the record is bare as to the actions of PCR counsel, a remand could be warranted. Here, PCR counsel could not be considered ineffective for failing to raise an IAC claim against trial counsel, given that the 9th found that any such claim would be meritless."

Near the end of last summer, he asked me to please move home permanently and start really working on starting a family.

"Our job as writers is to keep readers reading. Beyond that, we want to make them forget they are reading so they feel they are in the story and have a stake in the outcome. That's easiest to do in scenes, which consist primarily of action and dialogue with some internalization and description sprinkled in. But narrative, much maligned, is often useful or even necessary despite the bad rap it gets from the oh-so-often-repeated \"show don't tell\" rule we all throw around."

Hef, you see, is a man who has grown accustomed to making a gigantic anus of himself. The older he gets, the more anus-like he becomes. If he continues on his current path, he will be all anus and no cheeks. This will make him the terrestrial equivalent of a black hole, sucking passing bodies into his vortex and transporting them to the parallel universe inside The Playboy Mansion. Only by draining the anus of its cash supply will it be sapped of its lethal power, allowing Hef to live out his final years in dignity and peace."

Although communist governments murdered and repressed even more people than the Nazis, their crimes have gotten only a tiny fraction of the public awareness and recognition extend to the latter. But does that neglect matter? After all, the major communist regimes have either collapsed (the USSR and its Eastern European satellites) or evolved into much less oppressive forms (China and Vietnam). But there are several reasons why increasing recognition of communist crimes should be an important priority: providing justice for victims and perpetrators; alleviating the oppression of the unreformed communist governments that still exist today; and ensuring that comparable atrocities are never repeated...."

"In The Blue Light Project, Taylor has once again put his literary finger on cultural currents just at the moment of their emergence from our collective subconscious — big ideas like the dynamics and ritual nature of celebrity culture, the need to find (like the freesteal artists) a way of moving freely and creatively through our world, and our ability, through the power of individual choice, to continue to tell our own stories, in the face of unprecedented external scrutiny and manipulation. It is this ability, I think, that imbues his writing with its sense of uncanny fascination, and keeps one returning to the ideas long after the book is finished."

Heck, ALTERED DREAMS has all of my thoughts and feelings in it. I am the proverbial open book!"

Lunch was just a Food Doctor Wholesome Pot as I had to spend my lunch hour running errands so I needed something quick, warm and filling! This was closely followed by a ginger bread Nakd bar. Mid afternoon I had to pop out of work for five minutes so I took the opportunity to buy myself a bag of peanut M&M’s – not great, but I had some good news to celebrate!

"Saturday, I slept most of the day. My amazing husband knew how tired I was after our eventful week and took care of the kids most of the day. He woke me in the afternoon and told me that Tenli had a slight fever of 99.9. She acted normal most of the day and we gave her motrin to help with her fever. At dinner she didn't eat much; we started baths afterwards and she began to shiver so badly when I undressed her she couldn't hardly talk. When I got her out she was shivering so much her lips turned blue! I waited a while and took her temperature and it was 104.0! I gave her some tylenol and sat with her on the couch for a few minutes before deciding to take her to Kidmed. I figured the earlier we could get antibiotics in her the easier it would be to avoid the hospital! When we got to kidmed she was lethargic and her cheeks were rosy. All she wanted to do was sleep, and would not let go of me! I sat in the waiting room for 45 minutes with her on my lap, after 20 minutes of waiting she vomited all over my shirt and pants! The lady at the desk called out to me that there are bags on the wall, but I was so filled with chunks of food, and Tylenol in my lap that there was no getting up unless she wanted to scrape it up off the floor. FINALLY she brought on over to me, but it was too late she already spewed it all over my lap! I took off her clothes down to the diaper and took her to the bathroom to clean her and me off! As I came out of the bathroom I held her in my arms pacing the floor trying to soothe her to sleep while the heat from her body baked my skin! I paced for about 15 minutes while listening and watching a nurse have a personal conversation with another patient sitting in the waiting room. Getting annoyed (and ready to leave for the ER), I asked the desk clerk how much longer before they could see her and she said, \"about 1-2 more minutes.\" About a minute later the nurse who was having the conversation turned to me and said, \"is this Tenli, I'm out here for her...we were just chatting!\" I was IRATE! Here I am covered with vomit, rocking my baby who had a 104 degree temp, and was miserable and she was \"chatting!\" We went back to the room and was seen by the doctor, they did a strep swab, flue swab, and x-ray. She was positive for pneumonia, and negative for everything else."
"Another subject I will touch on is something I mentioned in my “Opinions of the world around me” blog, and that’s the child aspect of it. I talked a bit about it but now I will go more in-depth with it. Just like men and women, children deserve respect as well. The problem is, neither of them gives it to them. Children deserve a lot more than we do because they are growing, learning and figuring out the world around them. They drive us mad, they make awe moments, they push our buttons, they make cute faces; it’s what kids do. Parenthood is one job that is 24/7/365 and is probably the most difficult but most rewarding job anyone could ever have; no matter whether you’re flipping burgers or the CEO of the largest company on the planet; parenthood tops it all. This brings me to a question; why is it that parents feel the need to disrespect their kids? The answer; I don’t know, every parents thinks differently."

"Essential Sites: The first five years of the band from 1977 to 1982 will comprise a good hunk, but certainly is not all of the important terrain that must be covered. “Live at The Witch Trials” is their first LP that was released in 1979 and has all of their classic ingredients. Ranting vocals from Smith combine with musician’s Bramah, Riley and Burns to ensure a guitar driven sound that was remarkably tight for the evolving punk rock landscape. Bassist Steve Hanley and guitarist Craig Scanlon enter in 1980 and in quick succession, “Grotesque (After the Gramme”), “Slates” and “Hex Enduction Hour” become a must-hear part of The Fall canon. The Hanley/Scanlon axis adds slashing guitar and bass to at-times venomous lyrics from Mark E. Smith (M.E.S.). “Totally Wired,” “N.W.R.A.” and “An Older Lover,” as well as “The Classical,” rank among the finest tracks they ever recorded. This period holds the essence of their organized cacophony that other bands have frequently imitated, but never succeeded in duplicating. That correct blend of riffs, minimalist freedom and bile could only be directed by one M.E.S."

How could you not want to read this book? Now if it was called “How a Christian Lost Weight” or “Christians are Fat Too” would it have intrigued people to read the book? Probably not. I notice that the title of a blog post can increase my readership for the day. The more funny or intriguing a post is the more readers I have. With so many of us having 100s of blogs in our Reader, we need to quickly decide what to read, just like a book. If the title doesn't grab me, then I'm not going to pick it up or click on it. Sorry, it's true. I bet you have never thought of it that way. Why do you pick up books? Because either the title intrigues you or the artwork does. Same with a blog. I've written some great posts, only to see that no one has read it. Unfortunately, we are in “buyers market” in the bloggy world. If we can't “sell” our posts to our readers, they won't get read.

"Needless to say, it is pretty tough to please the whole crowd. In case that is not enough to keep a gal on her toes, last night the girls had a friend over – so we had nine to feed. And we had our first 80 degree day of the year, so turning on the oven seemed counter productive to the efforts to keep the house cool. When you are a family of two or three, you can make last minute decisions and substitute different dishes than the one you had planned to make. That is tougher to do when cooking for eight (or on this particular night – nine.) Not to worry – I had a stroke of genius. I would simply make taco salad. We had all of the needed ingredients on hand. I would not need to turn on the oven. It was quick and easy AND my brood could pick and choose only adding what they liked to their salad. Taylor could skip the tomatoes. Justin could skip the tomatoes and the beans but have plenty of corn. Landon could go heavy on the meat and beans but forego the veggies. etc. I got it all on the table and in plenty of time for everyone to make it to rehearsal. As I sat down to dinner quite pleased with myself, I looked around the table and saw each face fall. What?! “I thought you all liked taco salad.” And then my oldest and most sympathetic bonus child looked at me and said, “Oh we do. It’s just that this is what we had last night at mom’s house.” How could I have known?! Drat! Back to the drawing board. Tonight I am trying sweet orange chicken. At least I know that’s not what they had last night."

What matters is whether the wages are even lower in labor-exporting countries. Such is the logic of globalization."

Kipling said, “If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, Or walk with kings – nor lose common touch.” It’s funny how subconsciously I’ll alter my language in order to find acceptance with my driver, or someone I meet. “Bastard,” “Bloody,” “Crap” became regular devices around the rougher types. It didn’t take me long however to figure out that it wasn’t my language that got me accepted, it was just being authentic. Thankfully I scrubbed that approach before it was too late.

"In 2001 an obscure Finnish developer, Remedy, released one of the most defining action games of all time. Max Payne had been in development for four years, an unheard-of amount of time for the period, as Remedy attempted to get the game's tricky mix of film noir storyline, John Woo-inspired action and a new gameplay mechanic called 'bullet time' (in which time slows down to a point where individual bullets can be seen in motion) to gel together. Other events outpaced the game's gestation: development was effected by the release of The Matrix in 1999, which popularised bullet time on a huge scale and led to the introduction of several homages to the film in the game. The game's lengthy development was likened to that of Daikatana (the most colossal disappointment in the history of gaming), which did not bode well, especially as Max Payne's development was actually longer. Fortunately, upon release Max Payne was critically-acclaimed and commercially hugely successful."

"British daily The Independent, the newspaper that broke the scandal, reported that the BBC would be apologizing to an estimated 74 million people globally over the matter. The report said viewers from “Kuala Lumpur to Khartoum” will be able to watch the broadcast which is available to 295 million homes, 1.7 million hotel rooms, 81 cruise ships, 46 airlines and 35 mobile phone platforms, at four different time zones. According to the BBC statement, the BBC Trust’s editorial standards committee had identified various breaches in editorial guidelines due to the errant programmes."

"So I encourage you, if you should happen to see, for example, a wooden puzzle with “Ages 2+” on the box, but you know that your little one would love to try it out at 18 months, go ahead and give it to your child. If your little one wants to hold your calculator, allow them some time with it. If your baby is just begging to get her hands on her older sibling’s bouncy ball, give it a go. (Just be sure they are supervised, that’s all.)"
"Magnesium’s role in stabilizing blood vessels is well documented, helping to prevent capillary and muscle spasms.

"We wish Genelia all the happiness for her married life as well as success for her movie which released this Friday. Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya is the story of Viren (Riteish Deshmukh) a rickshaw driver who works very hard to earn his livings. Mini (Genelia D’souza), on the other hand, is a rich brat who her father is trying to get married off but none of the suitors seem to please her. In a chance of fate, an accidently kidnapping ensues where the so-called kidnapper may actually be the one kidnapped. What loves is a sweet story between these two."

"One striking detail of the ending that is often overlooked, however, comes in the seconds just before Artiguez dies in a hail of bullets on a hospital staircase. As Zinnemann’s camera spins faster and faster around the hospital ward, the last image that pops into Artiguez’ head is the memory of young Paco kicking a soccer ball into the air. It seems like a random image, at first, but maybe it’s reminding Artiguez of a time when he was younger, and was happier—before he devoted himself to a life of crime."
"I feel like I have a talent at making mountains out of molehills. That it’s my fault and I should be able to do things. Especially basic things like eat and wash. But for some reason I just don’t. They become so meaningless and unimportant. Part of me is worried about my health. My diet is poor and erratic at best. It can’t be doing my body any good. But how do people manage to feed themselves properly everyday? How do they find the concentration and energy. I resolve to take better care of myself but it just doesn’t happen. The soul is willing; the mind is not."

I can't have the baby until after Rob gets back from China tomorrow though, so..... lol (Not like it would happen anyway. I've never dropped a baby early, including those two up there. *snicker* If we want to talk about having babies late though....) I'm still going to try to post everyday anyway as I like it."
"My experience has been that all dogs are smarter than I am, and they always know when I am packing treats and when I am not, and they are obedient when a treat is forthcoming and they may or may not be obedient otherwise, depending on their mood."
"This novel explores our world in the future where politics have tainted everything. Ethics of what should be allowable is a sub-plot that does not seem as far fetched as we may sometimes hope. The novel rotates between the first person perspective of the two main characters. There is elements of mystery, action, suspense, and even a little romance. Family relationships and connections in politics are explored from the point of view of a privileged member of society and that of someone on the outskirts. This is a very well written book."
"While walking the store we stumbled upon the video camera section. Josh and I own one and let me just say this - it takes TAPES. Needless to say, while it wasn't on our priority list, we do need a new one, desperately. Well, we saw a many newer ones than what we currently own."

"...under the judgmental pretending-not-to-be-judgmental gaze of my mother, I asked them to put the books away. This is really sad to me. This mother is forced to choose between pleasing her kids and pleasing her mother. She ends up sending the message to her kids that Grandma's wishes are more important than theirs, and her own. WHY? Why does the oldest person get to have it her way? Why does a mother (grandmother) still think she gets to call the shots, even when her kids are grown up enough to have their own families?"

"Cassia has always trusted the Society to make the right choices for her: what to read, what to watch, what to believe. So when Xander's face appears on-screen at her Matching ceremony, Cassia knows with complete certainty that he is her ideal mate . . . until she sees Ky Markham's face flash for an instant before the screen fades to black. The Society tells her it's a glitch, a rare malfunction, and that she should focus on the happy life she's destined to lead with Xander. But Cassia can't stop thinking about Ky, and as they slowly fall in love, Cassia begins to doubt the Society's infallibility and is faced with an impossible choice: between Xander and Ky, between the only life she's known and a path that no one else has dared to follow."

"“I-” Creme stopped short. Had she not already done so when she burnt down that building? Was there really any difference in doing so with fire than with any other mage spell?

"This year we are into a different belt of learning altogether. With the commencement 2012, the energies shifted subtly from trust to freewill. We are back at the helm of our lives and we are absolutely free to steer us where we will. It is a year of paradigm shift but that shift is not collective. We would be mistaken in envisioning fantastic events beyond our control manoeuvring us towards a great change more in accordance with the universe. No! It is a year of paradigm shift in that it begins with each individual undergoing great personal change that would reshape our personalities, goals and evolutionary paths. And as more individuals make the right choice the shift turns global and collective. Imagine series of tiny tube lights set in geometric shapes. Each beginning to flicker and finally glow one by one. Once all the tubes light up the whole shift from darkness to the light is complete!"

"Another delay...the evening my husband went out of town, he put a new bottle of water on our water dispenser and the next morning we woke to find that all the water had disappeared! This mystery lead me into the crawl space where I found that thanks to a crack in the water jug, all the water had leaked out and ran between my floor and the moldings. The insulation under this area in the kitchen was good and wet, so I pulled it out and discovered we had an unwanted view of my backyard! It is about now that I am wondering when Mike is due home! So, instead of working on my stairs, I took a trip to Home Depot for insulation, dressed in my best rubber gloves, mask, goggles and toque and got to work. Oh, if you could have seen me!"
"In Matthew 7:15 Jesus tells us to “Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep’s clothing.” In other words, they will look and appear to be sheep just like we are – they will fit right in the flock. But then Jesus concludes “but inwardly are ravaging wolves. You’ll recognize them by their fruit.” We had a family discussion the other night about fruit and how you might truly discern the fruitfulness of a person. But how many of us even think about being fruit-watchers?"

"Like I said... I am an emotional mess. So over the moon happy this baby is coming and is ours forever to absolute hysterics because all I really want is Makenzie. I am then hysterical apologizing to this baby for not showing them the love the deserve and that I really do want them and that I just miss their sister. This past week the emotions of this child being from a sperm donor has been extremely emotional. I think I have mentioned this before but Ryan has always been so confident and positive about this. Knowing this child is HIS. No ifs ands or buts. He has been so good about it and honestly going through all the IUI's and getting pregnant so was I. I have felt so good about it all. Knowing this was the right choice. Over the past week its not that I regret our choices because I absolutely don't. This child was so meant to come to us this way and this was the only way we could get them to us healthy. but the feelings of how will we tell them and when will we tell them? The thoughts of how will we do this again? The fear that maybe at some point Ryan will have some concerns or worries. Its been weird talking about what this baby might look like. I keep catching myself from saying things like-- Oh I pray he has your nose or butt or hair color... Whatever it might be. I fully believe this child will be a mini replica of Ryan (if its a boy). I can only imagine Ryan's little partner. There is no doubt about that. But the fear in the back of my mind is oozing out with my added pregnancy hormones. It gets exhausting and overwhelming. I would love to hear from anyone of you that might have used a sperm or even an egg donor. Did you ever have similar fears or concerns. How have you decided and when to tell your child? I don't want it to be a big deal because its not. Its very simple. Its very matter of fact. There is no other Daddy somewhere- Ryan will be the name on that birth certificate. I just don't want it to be something that later down the road when it does come out that they feel I was hiding something from them. I have been very open about it with friends and family and its now all over the internet. Never have I thought it would be a secret. I know I have a lot of time to think about this but its on my mind now. So if y'all have advice. I would so much appreciate it!"

"Janet is my husband’s ex-wife. Janet is the mother of my two step-daughters. Janet has been a stalker of mine, though it appears she may have gone dormant. I don’t say this tongue-in-cheek; she truly did stalk me for about 2 years. Her methods included giving keys to the house she and her husband lived in- a house I moved into after she took their daughters and left for England- to neighbors who broke in and made copies of my journal and sent them to her, and having the same sets of neighbors raid our garbage cans once they hit curbside so that she knew what our kids were getting for birthdays and Christmas, etc. I swear to the Man Upstairs that this is the truth.

"What makes the Rifleman Dread so good? Autocannons aren’t that scary, right? Riflemen Dreadnoughts have a purpose – take out enemy vehicles AV 12 or less. Anything over that is a job for the Meltas. 4 shots that are twin linked are pretty darn reliable to hit. Str 7 vs AV 12 doesn’t sound great, but consider you should be hitting 3-4 times, so odds are you’re doing a point of damage. And, you can start tagging opponents across the map turn 1 too. And after you kill his vehicles, you’re probably inflicting 3-4 wounds on a unit as well. The Dreadnought can also take twin linked Lascannon and Missile Launcher for 145pts (what a lot of people take as it comes in the plastic kit.) For 20 extra points you lose two shots. Overall, the Missile Launcher and the Autocannons are a push for tank busting, though in this case the Autocannons are twin linked so it’s actually in favour of the Rifleman. The twin-linked Lascannon is slightly better than the twin-linked autocannon, but is it 20pts better? I don’t think so."

I didn't think it would affect me so much, but it did. It was all I could do to keep from bursting out in tears every time I looked at another family. Jimmy was done eating, and wanted to go and play. I just KNEW that the Mayor of Whooville would ream me out if Jim left the table, so I made him sit. He was trying to get away, and fell off the chair, and bumped his head on the floor. I was upset, and didn't give him the comfort that he really needed. I know, I can be a heartless mom.

"After a number of years we decided that raising poultry on a commercial scale was not something we felt comfortable with. I wrote a post about that here. So now what? When you’re used to having eggs everywhere, you get used to having as many fresh eggs as you want. We realized quickly that moving one to two dozen hens around every three days would not be realistic, nor did we want them in a feathernet for a long period of time. Once you quit moving your stock, the predators become less unsettled and they settle in for the long haul, and the heavy manure buildup from chickens is hard on the soil. Keeping the chickens safe was high on the priority list, and next was ease of care. Chores become chores when they are repeated too often. Feeding the chickens everyday is a waste of time, when you can do it weekly. The same goes for watering."

"But above and beyond all those things, I miss him no matter what I’m doing. When putting on moisturizer on in the dark getting ready for bed, I remember how that’s how I do it at times when Chase is home. Because he’s already laying down for bed and I don’t want to turn on a light and disturb him. Then I want to be able to look over at him lying in the bed and say something, or do something to get his attention. But he’s not there. Folding clothes I can picture him helping me, and I think of what I’d do if he was there. As I’m finishing getting the kids ready for church I can almost see him at the sink taking care of the breakfast dishes, and I want to flash him a smile and let him know that I appreciate him. Watching tv, I think of the analysis I’d be giving him. At the store, I see movies I think he’d like and I imagine watching them with him."

"The parish church is dedicated to St Mary the Virgin and was consecrated about the year 1050.

The registers date from 1679. Part of the former vicarage, located to the south of the church, dates from around 1378."

It felt like I was a beginner swimmer. Finally I was able to swim 100 yards, then 200 and 500 yards. The day came when I swam 3 500's with just a 30 second break in between. I was on cloud 9."
"It might be argued that this is all well and good when it comes to society at large, but should it apply to our children attending school? Shouldn’t they be, you know, protected from hate? Again, I see more good in protecting free speech. First of all, it is impossible to be objective about what speech is “bad.” People will always label speech that threatens their views as “wrong” or “offensive,” regardless of whether there is any truth to that claim. More importantly, children should be full participants in the democratic free exchange of ideas – we can’t expect them to handle ideas they find odious with maturity or sensibility if we do not teach them this skill. The Supreme Court over the years has spoken strongly in favor of this principle [emphasis mine]:"
"And fiddled whisper music on those strings"
"Who are your friends? And how did they come to be so? According to a recent study people like to make friends with others who share their same beliefs, values and interests, and the more choices they have, the more likely they are to choose these kinds of friends"

"Speaking of slutty, Matthew McConaghey's girlfirend Camilla Alves is wearing a black Kaufman Franco dress. It was a little too exposed for the Oscars in the front. Otherwise, a lovely dress and she does look great with Matthew in a Dolce & Gabbana suit. I just wish someone would make him cut his hair."
"PRAY RIDICULOUSLY HARD. I'm more committed than ever to praying for and with my kids. I know raising my teens into functioning adults is no walk in the park. I'm giving up before I get started and gonna cry out for Divine help and guidance constantly."

"Stage three: The stock and garlic should now be reduced. Take it off the heat and whisk in the creme fraiche, and then the parmesan. The mixture gets lovely and thick. Serve the broccoli and gnocchi into bowls, and then pour the parmesan cream over the top. It is very important to eat the gnocchi with a spoon to scoop up as much of the cream as possible."
"But wait, broadcast industry opponents say. Aren’t broadcasters the rich and powerful few disenfranchising the rest of the country from having ubiquitous wireless broadband? Only they won’t say it quite like that, but the point is worth examining. Just 10 to 15 percent of U.S. households rely exclusively on over-the-air television. There is some evidence of cord-cutting–i.e., people ditching pay service for free TV–but not to the extent to suggest that ratio will double anytime soon. And we don’t know much yet about the adoption rate of mobile over-the-air TV because where is it already?"

"My dear brothers and sisters in Christ, please know that God always listens to your prayers, and be aware that He speaks in so many different ways in response to these prayers. Be it through the advice of holy individuals in Scriptures like Christ or Paul, even the suggestions from your mother or peers that align with that of the Bible, or through nature if that is God’s plans to further reveal himself to you. Please do remember this as you continue to communicate to God in this 2-way dialogue. But know that God will respond to you with an answer that you may like or may not; nevertheless, this is God’s will and prepared path for us, and we must recognize that everything he has, is, or will allow in our lives are for our own benefit in our unique growth path toward Him, with our own unique sets of events and blessings. My loving brothers and sisters, do not waste your time attempting to “make things happen” and benefit ourselves by merely praying “in faith” because God knows what is truly in your heart."
